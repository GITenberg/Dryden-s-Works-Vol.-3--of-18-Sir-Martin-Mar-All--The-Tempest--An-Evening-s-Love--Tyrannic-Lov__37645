<h2>SIR MARTIN MAR-ALL.</h2>

<p>Sir Martin Mar-All is imitated from the French of Moliere: nor, even
with that qualification, is it entirely the work of Dryden. William
Cavendish, Duke of Newcastle, renowned for his loyalty and gallantry
during the civil wars, whether in compliance with the general custom
amongst the men of wit and honour at the court of Charles, or in order
to place himself upon a level with that voluminous authoress, his
Duchess, thought fit to compose several plays. Amongst other
lucubrations, he translated Moliere's "<i>L'Etourdi</i>," and presented it to
our author, by whom it was adapted for the stage. From respect to his
Grace, it was published anonymously until 1697, when it appeared with
Dryden's name. The noble Duke being far more eminent as a soldier and an
equestrian, than as an author, it may be readily allowed, that what is
diverting in the piece has been inserted by our author. Upon the stage,
indeed, the repeated and incorrigible blunders of Sir Martin must have
appeared very diverting, since the play ran for no less than
thirty-three nights, and was four times acted at court. Nokes, who acted
this unfortunate coxcomb with inimitable humour, is said to have
contributed much to this uncommon success. Moliere's play is followed
with considerable exactness, allowing for such variations as the change
of the scene from Paris to London appeared naturally to demand. One
remarkable difference occurs in the conclusion: Coelie is, in the
original, at length united to her inconsiderate and blundering admirer.
Mrs Millisent, the corresponding character in Sir Martin Mar-all,
rewards, with her hand and fortune, the ingenious Warner, who has all
along laboured to gain her for his master. The alternative was a little
embarrassing; but the decorum of the French stage would not have
permitted the union of a lady with an intriguing domestic, nor would an
English audience have been less shocked with seeing her bestowed on a
fool. Besides, Sir Martin Mar-all is a more contemptible character than
Lelie, who is less conceited and foolish, than thoughtless and
inconsequential. But although the character of a menial was not quite so
low in the 17th as in the 18th century,&mdash;for pages, and the higher
class of attendants in a nobleman's family, were often men of some
birth,&mdash;yet there is much grossness in the conduct of the lady,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a></span>
who, in pure admiration of wit, marries a man, who never thought
of her.</p>

<p>"<i>L'Amant Indiscret</i>," of Quinault, another French play, has also been
consulted by Dryden in furbishing forth the Duke of Newcastle's labours.
In that part of the play, which occasions its second title of "The
feigned Innocence," the reader will hardly find wit enough to
counterbalance the want of delicacy.</p>

<p>Sir Martin Mar-all was performed by the Duke of York's servants,
probably at the desire of the Duke of Newcastle, as Dryden was engaged
to write for the other house. It seems to have been acted in 1667, and
was published, but without the author's name, in 1668.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a></span></p>

<h3>ACT I. SCENE I.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Warner</span> <i>solus</i>.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Where the devil is this master of mine? he is ever out of the
way, when he should do himself good! This 'tis to serve a coxcomb, one
that has no more brains than just those I carry for him. Well! of all
fops commend me to him for the greatest; he's so opinioned of his own
abilities, that he is ever designing somewhat, and yet he sows his
stratagems so shallow, that every daw can pick them up: From a plotting
fool, the Lord deliver me. Here he comes;&mdash;O! it seems his cousin's
with him; then it is not so bad as I imagined.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Sir <span class="smcap">Martin Mar-all</span>, <i>and</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Dupe</span>.<br />
</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> I think 'twas well contrived for your access, to lodge her in
the same house with you.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> 'Tis pretty well, I must confess.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Had he plotted it himself, it had been admirable.<br /> <span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[8]</a></span></p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> For when her father Moody writ to me to take him lodgings, I
so ordered it, the choice seemed his, not mine.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> I have hit of a thing myself sometimes, when wiser heads
have missed it; but that might be mere luck.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> Fortune does more than wisdom.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Nay, for that you shall excuse me; I will not value any
man's fortune at a rush, except he have wit and parts to bear him out.
But when do you expect them?</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> This tide will bring them from Gravesend. You had best let
your man go, as from me, and wait them at the stairs in Durham-yard.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Lord, cousin, what a-do is here with your counsel! As though
I could not have thought of that myself. I could find in my heart not to
send him now&mdash;&mdash;stay a little&mdash;&mdash;I could soon find
out some other way.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> A minute's stay may lose your business.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Well, go then; but you must grant, if he had staid, I could
have found a better way&mdash;you grant it.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> For once I will not stand with you. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Warner</span>.] 'Tis a
sweet gentlewoman, this Mrs Millisent, if you can get her.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Let me alone for plotting.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> But by your favour, sir, 'tis not so easy; her father has
already promised her; and the young gentleman comes up with them: I
partly know the man&mdash;but the old squire is humoursome; he's stout,
and plain in speech, and in behaviour; he loves none of the fine town
tricks of breeding, but stands up for the old Elizabeth way in all
things. This we must work upon.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Sure you think you have to deal with a fool, cousin?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[9]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Mrs <span class="smcap">Christian</span>.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> O my dear niece, I have some business with you.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Whispers.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Sir. Mart.</i> Well, madam, I'll take one turn here in the Piazzas; a
thousand things are hammering in this head; 'tis a fruitful noddle,
though I say it.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exit</i> Sir <span class="smcap">Mart.</span></span><br /></p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> Go thy ways for a most conceited fool&mdash;but to our
business, cousin: You are young, but I am old, and have had all the
love-experience that a discreet lady ought to have; and, therefore, let
me instruct you about the love this rich lord makes to you.</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> You know, madam, he's married, so that we cannot work upon that
ground of matrimony.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> But there are advantages enough for you, if you will be wise,
and follow my advice.</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> Madam, my friends left me to your care, therefore I will wholly
follow your counsel, with secrecy and obedience.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> Sweetheart, it shall be the better for you another day: Well
then, this lord that pretends to you is crafty and false, as most men
are, especially in love; therefore, we must be subtle to meet with all
his plots, and have countermines against his works, to blow him up.</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> As how, madam?</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> Why, girl, he'll make fierce love to you, but you must not
suffer him to ruffle you, or steal a kiss: But you must weep and sigh,
and say you'll tell me on't, and that you will not be used so, and play
the innocent, just like a child, and seem ignorant of all.</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> I warrant you I'll be very ignorant, madam.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> And be sure, when he has towsed you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[10]</a></span>
not to appear at supper that night, that you may
fright him.</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> No, madam.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> That he may think you have told me.</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> Ay, madam.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> And keep your chamber, and say your head aches.</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> O most extremely, madam.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> And lock the door, and admit of no night visits: At supper
I'll ask where's my cousin, and, being told you are not well, I'll start
from the table to visit you, desiring his lordship not to incommode
himself; for I will presently wait on him again.</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> But how, when you are returned, madam?</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> Then somewhat discomposed, I'll say, I doubt the meazles or
small-pox will seize on you, and then the girl is spoiled; saying, poor
thing, her portion is her beauty, and her virtue; and often send to see
how you do, by whispers in my servant's ears, and have those whispers of
your health returned to mine: If his lordship, thereupon, asks how you
do, I will pretend it was some other thing.</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> Right, madam, for that will bring him further in suspence.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> A hopeful girl! then will I eat nothing that night, feigning
my grief for you; but keep his lordship company at meal, and seem to
strive to put my passion off, yet shew it still by small mistakes.</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> And broken sentences.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> A dainty girl! and after supper visit you again, with promise
to return strait to his lordship; but after I am gone, send an excuse,
that I have given you a cordial, and mean to watch that night in person
with you.</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> His lordship then will find the prologue of
his trouble, doubting I have told you of his ruffling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[11]</a></span></p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> And more than that, fearing his father should know of it, and
his wife, who is a termagant lady: But when he finds the coast is clear,
and his late ruffling known to none but you, he will be drunk with joy.</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> Finding my simple innocence, which will inflame him more.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> Then what the lion's skin has failed him in, the fox's
subtlety must next supply, and that is just, sweetheart, as I would have
it; for crafty folks treaties are their advantage: especially when his
passion must be satisfied at any rate, and you keep shop to set the
price of love: so now you see the market is your own.</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> Truly, madam, this is very rational; and by the blessing of
heaven upon my poor endeavours, I do not doubt to play my part.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> My blessing and my prayers go along with thee.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Sir <span class="smcap">John Swallow</span>, Mrs <span class="smcap">Millisent</span>, <i>and</i>
Rose, <i>her maid</i>.</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> I believe, madam, here is the young heiress you expect, and with
her he who is to marry her.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> However I am Sir Martin's friend, I must not seem his enemy.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Madam, this fair young lady begs the honour to be known to
you.</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> My father made me hope it, madam.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> Sweet lady, I believe you have brought all the freshness of
the country up to town with you.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>They salute.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> I came up, madam, as we country-gentlewomen use, at an
Easter-term, to the destruction of tarts and cheese-cakes, to see a new
play, buy a new gown, take a turn in the park, and so down again to
sleep with my fore-fathers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[12]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Rather, madam, you are come up to the breaking of many a
poor heart, that, like mine, will languish for you.</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> I doubt, madam, you are indisposed with your voyage; will you
please to see the lodgings your father has provided for you?</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> To wait upon you, madam.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> This is the door; there is a gentleman will wait you
immediately in your lodging, if he might presume on your commands.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>In a whisper.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> You mean Sir Martin Mar-all: I am glad he has entrusted his
passion with so discreet a person. [<i>In a whisper.</i>] Sir John, let me
entreat you to stay here, that my father may have intelligence where to
find us.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> I shall obey you, madam.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exeunt women.</i></span><br /></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Sir <span class="smcap">Martin Mar-all</span>.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Sir Martin Mar-all! most happily encountered! how long have
you been come to town?</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Some three days since, or thereabouts: But, I thank God, I
am very weary on't already.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Why, what's the matter, man?</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> My villainous old luck still follows me in gaming; I never
throw the dice out of my hand, but my gold goes after them: If I go to
piquet, though it be but with a novice in't, he will picque and
repicque, and capot me twenty times together: and, which most mads me, I
lose all my sets when I want but one of up.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> The pleasure of play is lost, when one
loses at that unreasonable rate.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> But I have sworn not to touch either
cards or dice this half year.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> The oaths of losing gamesters are most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[13]</a></span>
minded; they forswear play as an angry servant
does his mistress, because he loves her but too well.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> But I am now taken up with thoughts of another nature; I am
in love, sir.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> That's the worst game you could have played at; scarce one
woman in an hundred will play with you upon the square. You venture at
more uncertainty than at a lottery: For you set your heart to a whole
sex of blanks. But is your mistress widow, wife, or maid?</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> I can assure you, sir, mine is a maid; the heiress of a
wealthy family, fair to a miracle.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Does she accept your service?</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> I am the only person in her favour.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Warner</span>.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Is she of town or country?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> How's this? <span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> She is of Kent, near Canterbury.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> What does he mean? This is his rival. <span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Near Canterbury, say you? I have a small estate lies
thereabouts, and more concernments than one besides.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> I'll tell you then. Being at Canterbury, it was my fortune
once, in the Cathedral church&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> What do you mean, sir, to intrust this man with your affairs
thus?</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Trust him? why, he's a friend of mine.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> No matter for that; hark you, a word, sir.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Pr'ythee leave fooling; and as I was saying&mdash;&mdash;I
was in the church, when I first saw this fair one.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Her name, sir, I beseech you.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> For heaven's sake, sir, have a care.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Thou art such a coxcomb&mdash;Her name's Millisent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[14]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Now, the pox take you, sir, what do you mean?</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Millisent, say you? That's the name of my mistress.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Lord! what luck is that now! well, sir, it happened one of
her gloves fell down; I stooped to take it up; and, in the stooping,
made her a compliment.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> The devil cannot hold him; now will this thick-skulled master of
mine tell the whole story to his rival!</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> You'll say, 'twas strange, sir; but at the first glance we
cast on one another, both our hearts leaped within us, our souls met at
our eyes, and with a tickling kind of pain slid to each other's breast,
and in one moment settled as close and warm, as if they long had been
acquainted with their lodging. I followed her somewhat at a distance,
because her father was with her.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Yet hold, sir.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Saucy rascal, avoid my sight; must you tutor me?&mdash;So,
sir, not to trouble you, I enquired out her father's house, without
whose knowledge I did court the daughter, and both then, and often since
coming to Canterbury, I received many proofs of her kindness to me.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> You had best tell him too, that I am acquainted with her maid,
and manage your love under-hand with her.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Well remembered, i'faith; I thank thee for that, I had
forgot it, I protest! My valet de chambre, whom you see here with me,
grows me acquainted with her woman.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> O the devil!</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> In fine, sir, this maid, being much in her mistress's
favour, so well solicited my cause, that, in fine, I gained from fair
mistress Millisent an assurance of her kindness, and an engagement to
marry none but me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[15]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> 'Tis very well! you have made a fair discovery!</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> A most pleasant relation, I assure you: You are a happy man,
sir! but what occasion brought you now to London?</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> That was in expectation to meet my mistress here; she writ
me word from Canterbury, she and her father shortly would be here.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> She and her father, said you, sir?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Tell him, sir, for heaven's sake tell him all.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> So I will, sir, without your bidding: Her father and she are
come up already, that's the truth on't, and are to lodge by my
contrivance in yon house; the master of which is a cunning rascal as any
in town&mdash;&mdash;him I have made my own, for I lodge there.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> You do ill, sir, to speak so scandalously of my landlord.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Peace, or I'll break your fool's head; so, that by his means
I shall have free egress and regress when I please, sir, without her
father's knowledge.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> I am out of patience to hear this.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Methinks you might do well, sir, to speak openly to her
father.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Thank you for that, i'faith; in speaking to old Moody, I may
soon spoil all.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> So, now he has told her father's name, 'tis past recovery.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Is her father's name Moody, say you?</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Is he of your acquaintance?</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Yes, sir; I know him for a man who is too wise for you to
over-reach; I am certain he will never marry his daughter to you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[16]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Why, there's the jest of it: He shall never know it: 'Tis
but your keeping of my counsel; I'll do as much for you, mun.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> No, sir, I'll give you better; trouble not yourself about
this lady; her affections are otherwise engaged to my knowledge&mdash;&mdash;hark
in your ear&mdash;&mdash;her father hates a gamester like a devil: I'll keep your
counsel for that too.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Nay, but this is not all, dear Sir John?</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> This is all, I assure you: Only I will make bold to seek
your mistress out another lodging.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exit</i> Sir <span class="smcap">John</span>.</span><br /></p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Your affairs are now put into an excellent posture, thank your
incomparable discretion; this was a stratagem my shallow wit could never
have reached, to make a confident of my rival.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> I hope thou art not in earnest, man! Is he my rival?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> 'Slife, he has not found it out all this while! well, sir, for a
quick apprehension let you alone.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> How the devil camest thou to know on't? and why the devil
didst thou not tell me on't?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> To the first of your devils I answer, her maid, Rose, told me
on't: To the second, I wish a thousand devils take him that would not
hear me.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> O unparallelled misfortune!</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> O unparallelled ignorance! why he left her father at the
water-side, while he led the daughter to her lodging, whither I directed
him; so that if you had not laboured to the contrary, fortune had placed
you in the same house with your mistress, without the least suspicion of
your rival, or of her father. But 'tis well you have satisfied your
talkative humour: I hope you have some new project of your own to set
all right again: For my part, I confess all my designs for you are
wholly ruined; the very foundations of them are blown up.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[17]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Pr'ythee insult not over the destiny of a poor undone lover;
I am punished enough for my indiscretion in my despair, and have nothing
to hope for now but death.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Death is a bug-word; things are not brought to that extremity;
I'll cast about to save all yet.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter Lady</i> <span class="smcap">Dupe</span>.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> O, Sir Martin! yonder has been such a stir within; Sir John,
I fear, smokes your design, and by all means would have the old man
remove his lodging; pray God, your man has not played false.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Like enough I have: I am coxcomb sufficient to do it; my master
knows, that none but such a great calf as I could have done it, such an
overgrown ass, a self-conceited idiot as I.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Nay, Warner.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Pray, sir, let me alone: What is it to you if I rail upon
myself? Now could I break my own logger-head.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Nay, sweet Warner.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> What a good master have I, and I to ruin him: O beast!</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> Not to discourage you wholly, Sir Martin, this storm is
partly over.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> As how, dear cousin?</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> When I heard Sir John complain of the landlord, I took the
first hint of it, and joined with him, saying, if he were such an one, I
would have nothing to do with him: In short, I rattled him so well, that
Sir John was the first who did desire they might be lodged with me, not
knowing that I was your kinswoman.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Pox on't, now I think on't, I could have found out this
myself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[18]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Are you there again, sir? Now, as I have a soul&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Mum, good Warner, I did but forget myself a little; I leave
myself wholly to you, and my cousin: get but my mistress for me, and
claim whatever reward you can desire.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Hope of reward will diligence beget, Find you the money, and
I'll find the wit.<br />

<h3>ACT II. SCENE I.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Enter Lady</i> <span class="smcap">Dupe</span>, <i>and Mrs</i> <span class="smcap">Christian</span>.</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> It happened, madam, just as you said it would; but was he so
concerned for my feigned sickness?</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> So much, that Moody and his daughter, our new guests, take
notice of the trouble; but the cause was kept too close for strangers to
divine.</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> Heaven grant he be but deep enough in love, and
then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> And then thou shalt distil him into gold, my girl. Yonder he
comes, I'll not be seen: you know your lesson, child.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exit.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> I warrant you.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter Lord</i> <span class="smcap">Dartmouth</span>.</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> Pretty mistress Christian, how glad am I to meet you thus alone!</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> O the father! what will become of me now?</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> No harm, I warrant you; but why are you so afraid?</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> A poor weak innocent creature as I am, heaven of his mercy, how I
quake and tremble! I have not yet clawed off your last ill usage, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[19]</a></span>
now I feel my old fit come again; my ears tingle already, and my back
shuts and opens; ay, just so it began before.</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> Nay, my sweet mistress, be not so unjust to suspect any new
attempt: I am too penitent for my last fault, so soon to sin again. I
hope you did not tell it to your aunt.</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> The more fool I, I did not.</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> You never shall repent your goodness to me; but may not I
presume there was some little kindness in it, which moved you to conceal
my crime?</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> Methought I would not have mine aunt angry with you, for all this
earthly good; but yet I'll never be alone with you again.</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> Pretty innocence! let me sit nearer to you: You do not
understand what love I bear you. I vow it is so pure, my soul's not
sullied with one spot of sin: Were you a sister, or a daughter to me,
with a more holy flame I could not burn.</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> Nay, now you speak high words; I cannot understand you.</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> The business of my life shall be but how to make your fortune,
and my care and study to advance and see you settled in the world.</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> I humbly thank your lordship.</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> Thus I would sacrifice my life and fortunes, and in return you
cruelly destroy me.</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> I never meant you any harm, not I.</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> Then what does this white enemy so near me? [<i>Touching her hand
gloved.</i>] Sure 'tis your champion, and you arm it thus to bid defiance
to me.</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> Nay, fie, my lord! In faith, you are to blame.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Pulling her hand away.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> But I am for fair wars; an enemy must first be searched for
privy armour, ere we do engage.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Pulls at her glove.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> What does your lordship mean?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[20]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> I fear you bear some spells and charms about you, and, madam,
that's against the law of arms.</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> My aunt charged me not to pull off my glove, for fear of
sun-burning my hand.</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> She did well to keep it from your eyes, but I will thus preserve
it.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Hugging her bare hand.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> Why do you crush it so? nay, now you hurt me, nay&mdash;if
you squeeze it ne'er so hard&mdash;there's nothing to come out
on't&mdash;fie&mdash;is this loving one&mdash;what makes you take your
breath so short?</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> The devil take me if I can answer her a word; all my senses are
quite employed another way.</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> Ne'er stir, my lord, I must cry out.</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> Then I must stop your mouth&mdash;this ruby for a
kiss&mdash;that is but one ruby for another.</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> This is worse and worse.</p>

<p><i>Lady within.</i> Why, niece, where are you, niece?</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> Pox of her old mouldy chops.</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> Do you hear, my aunt calls? I shall be hanged for staying with
you&mdash;let me go, my lord.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Gets from him.</i></span><br /></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>Enter Lady</i> <span class="smcap">Dupe</span>.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> My lord! heaven bless me, what makes
your lordship here?</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> I was just wishing for you, madam; your niece and I have been so
laughing at the blunt humour of your country-gentleman. I must go pass
an hour with him.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.</span><br /></p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> You made a little too much haste; I was just exchanging a kiss
for a ruby.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> No harm done; it will make him come on the faster: Never full
gorge an hawk you mean to fly: The next will be a necklace of pearl, I
warrant you.</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> But what must I do next?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[21]</a></span></p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> Tell him I grew suspicious, and examined you whether he made
not love; which you denied. Then tell him how my maids and daughters
watch you; so that you tremble when you see his lordship.</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> And that your daughters are so envious, that they would raise a
false report to ruin me.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> Therefore you desire his lordship, as he loves you, of which
you are confident, henceforward to forbear his visits to you.</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> But how, if he should take me at my word?</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> Why, if the worst come to the worst, he leaves you an honest
woman, and there's an end on't: But fear not that; hold out his
messages, and then he'll write, and that is it, my bird, which you must
drive it to: Then all his letters will be such ecstasies, such vows and
promises, which you must answer short and simply, yet still ply out of
them your advantages.</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> But, madam! he's in the house, he will not write.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> You fool&mdash;he'll write from the next chamber to you; and,
rather than fail, send his page post with it, upon a hobby-horse: Then
grant a meeting, but tell me of it, and I'll prevent him by my being
there; he'll curse me, but I care not. When you are alone, he'll urge
his lust, which answer you with scorn and anger.</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> As thus an't please you, madam. What! Does he think I will be
damn'd for him? Defame my family, ruin my name, to satisfy his pleasure?</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> Then he will be profane in his arguments, urge nature's laws
to you.</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> By'r lady, and those are shrewd arguments; but I am resolved I'll
stop my ears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[22]</a></span>
<i>L. Dupe.</i> Then when he sees no other thing will move you, he'll sign a
portion to you beforehand: Take hold of that, and then of what you will.<br />

<h3>SCENE II.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Enter Sir</i> <span class="smcap">John</span>, <i>Mrs</i> <span class="smcap">Millisent</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Rose</span>.<br /></p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Now, fair Mrs Millisent, you see your chamber; your father
will be busy a few minutes, and in the mean time permits me the
happiness to wait on you.</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> Methinks you might have chose us better lodgings, this house is
full; the other, we saw first, was more convenient.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> For you, perhaps, but not for me: You might have met a lover
there, but I a rival.</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> What rival?</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> You know Sir Martin, I need not name
it to you.</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> I know more men besides him.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> But you love none besides him: Can you deny your affection
to him?</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> You have vexed me so, I will not satisfy you.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Then I perceive I am not likely to be so much obliged to
you, as I was to him.</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> This is romance&mdash;I'll not believe a word on't.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> That's as you please: However 'tis believed, his wit will
not much credit your choice. Madam, do justice to us both; pay his
ingratitude and folly with your scorn; my service with your love. By
this time your father stays for me: I shall be discreet enough to keep
this fault of yours from him; the lawyers wait for us to draw your
jointure; and I would beg your pardon for my absence, but that my crime
is punished in itself.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exit.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> Could I suspect this usage from a favoured servant!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[23]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> First hear Sir Martin, ere you quite condemn him; consider, 'tis
a rival who accused him.</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> Speak not a word in his behalf: Methought too, Sir John called
him fool.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> Indeed he has a rare way of acting a fool, and does it so
naturally, it can be scarce distinguished.</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> Nay, he has wit enough, that's certain.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> How blind love is!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Warner</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> How now, what's his business? I wonder, after such a crime, if
his master has the face to send him to me.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> How durst you venture hither? If either Sir John or my old
master see you!&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Pish! they are both gone out.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> They went but to the next street; ten to one but they return and
catch you here.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Twenty to one I am gone before, and save them a labour.</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> What says that fellow to you? What business can he have here?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Lord, that your ladyship should ask that question, knowing whom
I serve!</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> I'll hear nothing from your master.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Never breathe, but this anger becomes your ladyship most
admirably; but though you'll hear nothing from him, I hope I may speak a
word or two to you from myself, madam.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> 'Twas a sweet prank your master played us: A lady's well helped
up, that trusts her honour in such a person's hands: To tell
also,&mdash;&mdash;and to his rival too. Excuse him if thou canst.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> How the devil should I excuse him? Thou know'st he is the
greatest fop in nature.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside to </i><span class="smcap">Rose.</span></span><br /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[24]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> But my lady does not know it; if she did&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> I'll have no whispering.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Alas, madam, I have not the confidence to speak out, unless you
can take mercy on me.</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> For what?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> For telling Sir John you loved my master, madam. But sure I
little thought he was his rival.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> The witty rogue has taken it on himself.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> Your master then is innocent?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Why, could your ladyship suspect him guilty? Pray tell me, do
you think him ungrateful, or a fool?</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> I think him neither.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Take it from me, you see not the depth of him. But when he knows
what thoughts you harbour of him, as I am faithful, and must tell him, I
wish he does not take some pet, and leave you.</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> Thou art not mad, I hope, to tell him on't; if thou dost, I'll
be sworn, I'll forswear it to him.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Upon condition then you'll pardon me, I'll see what I can do to
hold my tongue.</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> This evening, in St James's Park, I'll meet him.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Knock within.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> He shall not fail you, madam.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> Somebody knocks&mdash;Oh, madam, what shall we do! 'Tis Sir John, I
hear his voice.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> What will become of me?</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> Step quickly behind that door.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<span class="smcap">Warner</span> <i>goes out</i>.</span><br /></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>To them Sir</i> <span class="smcap">John</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> You've made a quick despatch, sir.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> We have done nothing, madam; our man of law was not
within&mdash;but I must look for some writings.</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> Where are they laid?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[25]</a></span>
<i>Sir John.</i> In the portmanteau in the drawing-room.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Is going to the door</i>.</span><br /></p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> Pray stay a little, sir.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> [<i>At the door</i>.] He must pass just by me; and, if he sees me, I
am but a dead man.</p>

<p><i>Sir John</i>. Why are you thus concerned? why do you hold me?</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> Only a word or two I have to tell you. 'Tis of importance to
you.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Give me leave&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> I must not, before I discover the plot to you.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> What plot?</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> Sir Martin's servant, like a rogue, comes hither to tempt me
from his master, to have met him.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> [<i>At the door</i>.] Now, would I had a good bag of gunpowder at my
breech, to ram me into some hole!</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> For my part, I was so startled at the message, that I shall
scarcely be myself these two days.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Oh that I had the rascal! I would teach him to come upon
such errands.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Oh for a gentle composition, now! An arm or leg I would give
willingly.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> What answer did you make the villain?</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> I over-reached him clearly, by a promise of an appointment of a
place I named, where I never meant to come: But would have had the
pleasure, first, to tell you how I served him.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> And then to chide your mean suspicion of me; indeed I
wondered you should love a fool. But where did you appoint to meet him?</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> In Grays-Inn walks.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> By this light, she has put the change upon him! O sweet
womankind, how I love thee for that heavenly gift of lying!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[26]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> For this evening I will be his mistress; he shall meet
another Penelope than he suspects.</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> But stay not long away.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> You overjoy me, madam.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exit</i>.</span><br /></p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> [<i>Entering</i>.] Is he gone, madam?</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> As far as Grays-Inn walks: Now I have time to walk the other
way, and see thy master.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Rather let him come hither: I have laid a plot, shall send his
rival far enough from watching him, ere long.</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> Art thou in earnest?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> 'Tis so designed, fate cannot hinder it. Our landlord, where we
lie, vexed that his lodgings should be so left by Sir John, is resolved
to be revenged, and I have found the way. You'll see the effects on't
presently.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> O heavens! the door opens again, and Sir John is returned once
more.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter Sir</i> <span class="smcap">John</span>.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Half my business was forgot; you did not tell me when you
were to meet him. Ho! what makes this rascal here?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> 'Tis well you're come, sir, else I must have left untold a
message I have for you.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Well, what's your business, sirrah?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> We must be private first; 'tis only for your ear.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> I shall admire his wit, if in this plunge he can get off.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> I came hither, sir, by my master's order,&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> I'll reward you for it, sirrah, immediately.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> When you know all, I shall deserve it, sir: I came to sound the
virtue of your mistress: which I have done so cunningly, I have at last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[27]</a></span>
obtained the promise of a meeting. But my good master, whom I must
confess more generous than wise, knowing you had a passion for her, is
resolved to quit: And, sir, that you may see how much he loves you, sent
me in private to advise you still to have an eye upon her actions.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Take this diamond for thy good news; and give thy master my
acknowledgments.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Thus the world goes, my masters! he, that will cozen you,
commonly gets your goodwill into the bargain.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside</i>.</span><br /></p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Madam, I am now satisfied of all sides; first of your truth,
then of Sir Martin's friendship. In short, I find you two cheated each
other, both to be true to me.</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> Warner is got off as I would wish, and the knight over-reached.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside.</i></span><br /></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter to them the Landlord, disguised like a carrier.</i></p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> How now! what would this carrier have?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> This is our landlord, whom I told you of; but keep your
countenance.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside to her.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Land.</i> I was looking hereaway for one Sir John Swallow; they told me, I
might hear news of him in this house.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Friend, I am the man; what have you to say to me?</p>

<p><i>Land.</i> Nay, faith, sir, I am not so good a schollard to say much, but I
have a letter for you in my pouch, there's plaguy news in it, I can tell
you that.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> From whom is your letter?</p>

<p><i>Land.</i> From your old uncle Anthony.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Give me your letter quickly.</p>

<p><i>Land.</i> Nay, soft and fair goes far.&mdash;Hold you, hold you. It is not in
this pocket.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[28]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Search in the other, then; I stand on thorns.</p>

<p><i>Land.</i> I think I feel it now, this should be who.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Pluck it out then.</p>

<p><i>Land.</i> I'll pluck out my spectacles, and see first. [<i>Reads.</i>] To Mr
Paul Grimbard&mdash;apprentice to&mdash;&mdash;No, that's not for you, sir&mdash;that's for
the son of the brother of the nephew of the cousin of my gossip Dobson.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Pr'ythee despatch; dost thou not know the contents on't?</p>

<p><i>Land.</i> Yes, as well as I do my <i>pater noster.</i></p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Well, what's the business on't?</p>

<p><i>Land.</i> Nay, no great business; 'tis but only that your worship's
father's dead.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> My loss is beyond expression! How died he?</p>

<p><i>Land.</i> He went to bed as well to see to as any man in England; and when
he awakened the next morning&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> What then?</p>

<p><i>Land.</i> He found himself stark dead.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Well, I must of necessity take orders for my father's
funeral, and my estate; heaven knows with what regret I leave you,
madam.</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> But are you in such haste, sir? I see you take all occasions to
be from me.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Dear madam, say not so: a few days will, I hope, return me
to you.</p>

<p class="center"><i>To them Sir</i> <span class="smcap">Martin</span>.</p>

<p>Noble Sir Martin, the welcomest man alive! let me embrace my friend.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> How untowardly he returns the salute! Warner will be found out.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Well, friend! you have obliged me to you eternally.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[29]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> How have I obliged you, sir? I would have you to know I
scorn your words; and I would I were hanged if it be not the farthest of
my thoughts.</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> O cunning youth, he acts the fool most naturally. Were we alone,
how would we laugh together!<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> This is a double generosity, to do me favours, and conceal
'em from me; but honest Warner here has told me all.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> What has the rascal told you?</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Your plot to try my mistress for me&mdash;you understand me,
concerning your appointment.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Sir, I desire to speak in private with you.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> This impertinent rascal! when I am most busy, I am ever
troubled with him.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> But it concerns you I should speak with you, good sir.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> That's a good one, i'faith; thou knowest breeding well, that
I should whisper with a serving-man before company.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Remember, sir, last time it had been better&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Peace, or I'll make you feel my double fists; If I don't
fright him, the saucy rogue will call me fool before the company.</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> That was acted most naturally again.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> [<i>To him.</i>] But what needs this dissembling, since you are
resolved to quit my mistress to me?</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> I quit my mistress! that's a good one, i'faith.</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> Tell him you have forsaken me.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> I understand you, madam, you would save a quarrel; but,
i'faith, I'm not so base: I'll see him hanged first.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Madam, my master is convinced, in prudence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[30]</a></span> he should say so:
But love o'ermasters him; when you are gone perhaps he may.</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> I'll go then: Gentlemen, your servant; I see my presence brings
constraint to the company.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Mill.</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Rose</span>.</span><br /></p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> I'm glad she's gone; now we may talk more freely; for if you
have not quitted her, you must.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Pray, sir, remember yourself: did not you send me of a message
to Sir John, that for his friendship you had left mistress Millisent?</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Why, what an impudent lying rogue art thou!</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> How's this! Has Warner cheated me?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Do not suspect it in the least: You know, sir, it was not
generous, before a lady, to say he quitted her.</p>

<p><i>Sir John</i> O! was that it?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> That was all: Say yes, good Sir John&mdash;or I'll swinge you.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Yes, good Sir John.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> That's well; once in his life he has heard good counsel.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Heigh, heigh, what makes my landlord here? He has put on a
fool's coat, I think, to make us laugh.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> The devil's in him, he's at it again; his folly's like a sore in
a surfeited horse; cure it in one place, and it breaks out in another.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Honest landlord, i'faith, and what makes you here?</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Are you acquainted with this honest man?</p>

<p><i>Land.</i> Take heed what you say, sir.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>To Sir</i> <span class="smcap">Mart</span>. <i>softly</i>.</span><br /></p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Take heed what you say, sir! Why? who should I be afraid of?
of you, sir? I say, sir, I know him, sir; and I have reason to know
him, sir; for I am sure I lodge in his house, sir&mdash;nay, never think to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[31]</a></span>
terrify me, sir; 'tis my landlord here in Charles-street, sir.</p>

<p><i>Land.</i> Now I expect to be paid for the news I brought him.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Sirrah, did not you tell me that my father&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Land.</i> Is in very good health, for aught I know, sir; I beseech you to
trouble yourself no farther concerning him.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Who set you on to tell this lie?</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Ay, who set you on, sirrah? This was a rogue that would
cozen us both; he thought I did not know him: Down on your marrowbones,
and confess the truth: Have you no tongue, you rascal?</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Sure 'tis some silenced minister: He grows so fat he cannot
speak.</p>

<p><i>Land.</i> Why, sir, if you would know, 'twas for your sake I did it.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> For my master's sake! why, you impudent varlet, do you think to
'scape us with a lye?</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> How was it for his sake?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> 'Twas for his own, sir; he heard you were the occasion the lady
lodged not at his house, and so he invented this lie; partly to revenge
himself of you; and partly, I believe, in hope to get her once again
when you were gone.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Fetch me a cudgel, pr'ythee.</p>

<p><i>Land.</i> O good sir! if you beat me, I shall run into oil immediately.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Hang him, rogue; he's below your anger: I'll maul him for
you&mdash;the rogue's so big, I think 'twill ask two days to beat him
all over.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Beats him.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Land.</i> O rogue! O villain, Warner! bid him hold, and I'll confess,
sir.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[32]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Get you gone without replying: must such as you be prating?<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Beats him out.</i></span><br /></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Rose</span>.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> Sir, dinner waits you on the table.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Friend, will you go along, and take part of a bad repast?</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Thank you; but I am just risen from table.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Now he might sit with his mistress, and has not the wit to find
it out.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> You shall be very welcome.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> I have no stomach, sir.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Get you in with a vengeance: You have a better stomach than you
think you have.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Pushes him.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> This hungry Diego rogue would shame me; he thinks a
gentleman can eat like a serving-man.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> If you will not, adieu, dear sir; in any thing command me.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exit.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Now we are alone: han't I carried matters bravely, sirrah?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> O yes, yes, you deserve sugar-plums; first for your quarrelling
with Sir John; then for discovering your landlord; and, lastly, for
refusing to dine with your mistress. All this is since the last
reckoning was wiped out.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Then why did my landlord disguise himself, to make a fool of
us?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> You have so little brains, that a penny-worth of butter, melted
under 'em, would set 'em afloat: He put on that disguise, to rid you of
your rival.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Why was not I worthy to keep your counsel then?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> It had been much at one: You would but have drunk the secret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[33]</a></span>
down, and pissed it out to the next company.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Well, I find I am a miserable man: I have lost my mistress,
and may thank myself for it.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> You'll not confess you are a fool, I warrant.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Well, I am a fool, if that will satisfy you: But what am I
the nearer, for being one?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> O yes, much the nearer; for now fortune's bound to provide for
you; as hospitals are built for lame people, because they cannot help
themselves. Well; I have a project in my pate.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Dear rogue, what is't?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Excuse me for that: But while 'tis set a working, you would do
well to screw yourself into her father's good opinion.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> If you will not tell me, my mind gives me, I shall discover
it again.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Rose</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Warner</span> <i>meeting</i>.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> Your worship's most happily encountered.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Your ladyship's most fortunately met.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> I was going to your lodging.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> My business was to yours.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> I have something to say to you that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> I have that to tell you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> Understand then&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[34]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> If you'll hear me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> I believe that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> I am of opinion, that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> Pry'thee hold thy peace a little, till I have done.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Cry you mercy, Mrs Rose; I'll not dispute your ancient privilege
of talking.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> My mistress, knowing Sir John was to be abroad upon business
this afternoon, has asked leave to see a play: And Sir John has so great
a confidence of your master, that he will trust no body with her, but
him.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> If my master gets her out, I warrant her, he shall shew her a
better play than any is at either of the houses&mdash;here they are: I'll run
and prepare him to wait upon her.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exit.</i></span><br /></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter old</i> <span class="smcap">Moody</span>, <i>Mrs</i> <span class="smcap">Millisent</span>, <i>and Lady</i> <span class="smcap">Dupe</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> My hoods and scarfs there, quickly.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> Send to call a coach there.</p>

<p><i>Mood.</i> But what kind of man is this Sir Martin, with whom you are to
go?</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> A plain down-right country-gentleman, I assure you.</p>

<p><i>Mood.</i> I like him much the better for it. For I hate one of those you
call a man of the town, one of those empty fellows of mere out-side:
They have nothing of the true old English manliness.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> I confess, sir, a woman's in a bad condition, that has nothing
to trust to, but a peruke above, and a well-trimmed shoe below.</p>

<p class="center"><i>To them Sir</i> <span class="smcap">Martin</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> This, sir, is Sir John's friend; he is for your humour, sir; he
is no man of the town, but bred up in the old Elizabeth way of
plainness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[35]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Ay, madam, your ladyship may say your pleasure of me.</p>

<p class="center"><i>To them</i> <span class="smcap">Warner</span>.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> How the devil got he here before me! 'Tis very unlucky I could
not see him first.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> But, as for painting, music, poetry, and the like, I'll say
this of myself&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> I'll say that for him, my master understands none of them, I
assure you, sir.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> You impudent rascal, hold your tongue: I must rid my hands
of this fellow; the rogue is ever discrediting me before company.</p>

<p><i>Mood.</i> Never trouble yourself about it, sir, for I like a man that&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> I know you do, sir, and therefore I hope you'll think never
the worse of me for his prating: For, though I do not boast of my own
good parts&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> He has none to boast of, upon my faith, sir.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Give him not the hearing, sir; for, if I may believe my
friends, they have flattered me with an opinion of more&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Of more than their flattery can make good, sir; 'tis true he
tells you, they have flattered him; but, in my conscience, he is the
most down-right simple-natured creature in the world.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> I shall consider you hereafter, sirrah; but I am sure in all
companies I pass for a virtuoso.</p>

<p><i>Mood.</i> Virtuoso! What's that too? is not virtue enough without O so?</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> You have reason, sir.</p>

<p><i>Mood.</i> There he is again too; the town phrase; a great compliment I
wis! <i>you have reason, sir</i>; that is, you are no beast, sir.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[36]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> A word in private, sir; you mistake this old man; he loves
neither painting, music, nor poetry; yet recover yourself, if you have
any brains.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside to him.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Say you so? I'll bring all about again, I warrant you.&mdash;I
beg your pardon a thousand times, sir; I vow to gad I am not master of
any of those perfections; for, in fine, sir, I am wholly ignorant of
painting, music, and poetry; only some rude escapes; but, in fine, they
are such, that, in fine, sir&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> This is worse than all the rest.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Mood.</i> By coxbones, one word more of all this gibberish, and old Madge
shall fly about your ears: What is this, <i>in fine</i>, he keeps such a coil
with too?</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> 'Tis a phrase <i>a-la-mode</i>, sir; and is used in conversation now,
as a whiff of tobacco was formerly in the midst of a discourse for a
thinking while.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> In plain English, <i>in fine</i> is, in the end, sir.</p>

<p><i>Mood.</i> But, by coxbones, there is no end on't, methinks: If thou wilt
have a foolish word to lard thy lean discourse with, take an English one
when thou speakest English! as, so sir, and then sir, and so forth; 'tis
a more manly kind of nonsense: And a pox of, <i>in fine</i>, for I'll hear no
more on't.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> He's gravelled, and I must help him out. [<i>Aside.</i>] Madam,
there's a coach at the door, to carry you to the play.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Which house do you mean to go to?</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> The Duke's, I think.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> It is a damn'd play, and has nothing in't.</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> Then let us to the king's.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> That's e'en as bad.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> This is past enduring. [<i>Aside.</i>] There was an ill play set up,
sir, on the posts; but I can assure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[37]</a></span> you the bills are altered since you
saw them, and now there are two admirable comedies at both houses.</p>

<p><i>Mood.</i> But my daughter loves serious plays.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> They are tragi-comedies, sir, for both.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> I have heard her say, she loves none but tragedies.</p>

<p><i>Mood.</i> Where have you heard her say so, sir?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Sir, you forget yourself; you never saw her in your life before.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> What, not at Canterbury, in the Cathedral church there? This
is the impudentest rascal&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Mum, sir.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Ah Lord, what have I done! As I hope to be saved, sir, it
was before I was aware; for if ever I set eyes on her before this day, I
wish&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mood.</i> This fellow is not so much fool, as he makes one believe he is.</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> I thought he would be discovered for a wit: This 'tis to
over-act one's part!<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Mood.</i> Come away, daughter, I will not trust you in his hands; there's
more in it than I imagined.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Moody</span>, <span class="smcap">Mill.</span> <i>Lady</i>
<span class="smcap">Dupe</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Rose.</span></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Why do you frown upon me so, when you know your looks go to
the heart of me? What have I done besides a little <i>lapsus linguæ</i>?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Why, who says you have done any thing? You, a mere innocent!</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> As the child that's to be born, in my intentions; if I know
how I have offended myself any more than&mdash;&mdash;in one word&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> But don't follow me, however: I have nothing to say to you.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> I'll follow you to the world's end, till you forgive me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[38]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> I am resolved to lead you a dance then.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exit running.</i></span><br /></p>

<h3>SCENE II.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Enter Lady</i> <span class="smcap">Dupe</span>.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> Truly, my little cousin's the aptest scholar, and takes out
love's lessons so exactly, that I joy to see it; She has got already the
bond of two thousand pounds sealed for her portion, which I keep for
her; a pretty good beginning: 'Tis true, I believe he has enjoyed her,
and so let him; Mark Antony wooed not at so dear a price.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter, to her</i>, <span class="smcap">Christian</span>.</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> O madam, I fear I am breeding!</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> A taking wench! but 'tis no matter; have you told any body?</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> I have been venturing upon your foundations, a little to
dissemble.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> That's a good child; I hope it will thrive with thee, as it
has with me: Heaven has a blessing in store upon our endeavours.</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> I feigned myself sick, and kept my bed; my lord, he came to visit
me, and, in the end, I disclosed it to him, in the saddest passion!</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> This frightened him, I hope, into a study how to cloak your
disgrace, lest it should have vent to his lady.</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> 'Tis true; but all the while I subtly drove it, that he should
name you to me as the fittest instrument of the concealment; but how to
break it to you, strangely does perplex him. He has been seeking you all
over the house; therefore, I'll leave your ladyship, for fear we should
be seen together.<br />

<p class="center"><i>Enter Lord</i>.<br /></p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> Madam, I have a secret to impart; a sad one too, and have no
friend to trust, but only you.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> Your lady, or your children, sick?</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> Not that I know.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> You seem to be in health.</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> In body, not in mind.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> Some scruple of conscience, I warrant; my chaplain shall
resolve you.</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> Madam, my soul's tormented.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> O take heed of despair, my lord!</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> Madam, there is no medicine for this sickness, but only you;
your friendship's my safe haven, else I am lost, and shipwrecked.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> Pray tell me what it is.</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> Could I express it by sad sighs and groans, or drown it with
myself in seas of tears, I should be happy,&mdash;would, and would not tell.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> Command whatever I can serve you in; I will be faithful still
to all your ends, provided they be just and virtuous.</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> That word has stopt me.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> Speak out, my lord, and boldly tell what 'tis.</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> Then, in obedience to your commands; your cousin is with child.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> Which cousin?</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> Your cousin Christian, here in the house.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> Alas! then she has stolen a marriage, and undone herself:
Some young fellow, on my conscience, that's a beggar; youth will not be
advised: well, I'll never meddle more with girls; one is no more assured
of them, than grooms of mules; they'll strike when least one thinks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[40]</a></span>
on't: But pray, your lordship, what is her choice then for a husband?</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> She&mdash;&mdash;is not married, that I know of, madam.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> Not married! 'tis impossible; the girl does sure abuse you. I
know her education has been such, the flesh could not prevail;
therefore, she does abuse you, it must be so.</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> Madam, not to abuse you longer, she is with child, and I the
unfortunate man, who did this most unlucky act.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> You! I'll never believe it.</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> Madam, 'tis too true; believe it, and be serious how to hide her
shame; I beg it here upon my knees.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> Oh, oh, oh!<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>She faints away.</i></span><br /></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter two women</i>, <span class="smcap">Rose</span>, <i>and Mrs</i> <span class="smcap">Millisent</span>.</p>

<p><i>1 Wom.</i> O merciful God, my lady's gone!</p>

<p><i>2 Wom.</i> Whither?</p>

<p><i>1 Wom.</i> To heaven; God knows, to heaven!</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> Rub her, rub her; fetch warm clothes!</p>

<p><i>2 Wom.</i> I say, run to the cabinet of quintessence; Gilbert's water!
Gilbert's water!</p>

<p><i>1 Wom.</i> Now all the good folks of heaven look down upon her!</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> Set her in the chair.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> Open her mouth with a dagger or a key; pour, pour! Where's the
spoon?</p>

<p><i>2 Wom.</i> She stirs! she revives! merciful to us all! what a thing was
this? speak, lady, speak!</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> So, so, so!</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> Alas! my lord, how came this fit?</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> With sorrow, madam.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[41]</a></span></p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> Now I am better: Bess, you have not seen me thus?</p>

<p><i>1 Wom.</i> Heaven forefend that I should live to see you so again.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> Go, go, I'm pretty well; withdraw into the next room; but be
near, I pray, for fear of the worst. [<i>They go out.</i>] My lord, sit down
near me, I pray; I'll strive to speak a few words to you, and then to
bed; nearer, my voice is faint. My lord, heaven knows how I have ever
loved you; and is this my reward? Had you none to abuse but me in that
unfortunate fond girl, that you know was dearer to me than my life? This
was not love to her, but an inveterate malice to poor me. Oh,
oh!<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Faints again.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> Help, help, help!</p>

<p class="center"><i>All the women again.</i></p>

<p><i>1 Wom.</i> This fit will carry her: Alas, it is a lechery!</p>

<p><i>2 Wom.</i> The balsam, the balsam!</p>

<p><i>1 Wom.</i> No, no, the chemistry oil of rosemary: Hold her up, and give
her air.</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> Feel whether she breathes, with your hand before her mouth.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> No, madam, 'tis key-cold.</p>

<p><i>1 Wom.</i> Look up, dear madam, if you have any hope of salvation!</p>

<p><i>2 Wom.</i> Hold up your finger, madam, if you have any hope of fraternity.
O the blessed saints, that hear me not, take her mortality to them!</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> Enough, so, 'tis well&mdash;withdraw, and let me rest a while;
only my dear lord remain.</p>

<p><i>1 Wom.</i> Pray your lordship keep her from swebbing.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exeunt women.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> Here humbly, once again, I beg your pardon
and your help.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> Heaven forgive you, and I do: Stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[42]</a></span> up, my lord, and sit
close by me: O this naughty girl! But did your lordship win her soon?</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> No, madam, but with much difficulty.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> I'm glad on't; it shewed the girl had some religion in her;
all my precepts were not in vain: But you men are strange tempters; good
my lord, where was this wicked act, then, first committed?</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> In an out-room, upon a trunk.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> Poor heart, what shifts love makes! Oh, she does love you
dearly, though to her ruin! And then, what place, my lord?</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> An old waste room, with a decayed bed in't.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> Out upon that dark room for deeds of darkness! and that
rotten bed! I wonder it did hold your lordship's vigour: But you dealt
gently with the girl. Well, you shall see I love you: For I will manage
this business to both your advantages, by the assistance of heaven I
will; good my lord, help, lead me out.<br />

<h3>SCENE III.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Warner</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Rose</span>.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> A mischief upon all fools! do you think your master has not done
wisely? First to mistake our old man's humour; then to dispraise the
plays; and, lastly, to discover his acquaintance with my mistress: My
old master has taken such a jealousy of him, that he will never admit
him into his sight again.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Thou makest thyself a greater fool than he, by being angry at
what he cannot help. I have been angry with him too; but these friends
have taken up the quarrel. [<i>Shews gold.</i>] Look you, he has sent these
mediators to mitigate your wrath: Here are twenty of them have made a
long voyage from Guinea to kiss your hands: And when the match is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[43]</a></span>
made, there are an hundred more in readiness to be your humble servants.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> Rather than fall out with you, I'll take them; but I confess, it
troubles me to see so loyal a lover have the heart of an emperor, and
yet scarce the brains of a cobler.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Well, what device can we two beget betwixt us, to separate Sir
John Swallow and thy mistress?</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> I cannot on the sudden tell; but I hate him worse than foul
weather without a coach.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Then I'll see if my project be luckier than thine. Where are the
papers concerning the jointure I have heard you speak of?</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> They lie within, in three great bags; some twenty reams of paper
in each bundle, with six lines in a sheet: But there is a little paper
where all the business lies.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Where is it? Canst thou help me to it?</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> By good chance he gave it to my custody, before he set out for
London. You came in good time; here it is, I was carrying it to him;
just now he sent for it.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> So, this I will secure in my pocket; when thou art asked for it,
make two or three bad faces, and say it was left behind: By this means,
he must of necessity leave the town, to see for it in Kent.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter Sir</i> <span class="smcap">John</span>, <i>Sir</i> <span class="smcap">Martin</span>, <i>and Mrs</i> <span class="smcap">Millisent</span>.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> 'Tis no matter, though the old man be suspicious; I knew the
story all beforehand; and since then you have fully satisfied me of your
true friendship to me.&mdash;Where are the writings?<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Rose</span>.</span><br /></p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> Sir, I beg your pardon; I thought I had put them up amongst my
lady's things, and it seems, in my haste, I quite forgot them, and left
them at Canterbury.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[44]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> This is horribly unlucky! where do you think you left them?</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> Upon the great box in my lady's chamber; they are safe enough,
I'm sure.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> It must be so&mdash;I must take post immediately: Madam, for some
few days I must be absent; and to confirm you, friend, how much I trust
you, I leave the dearest pledge I have on earth, my mistress, to your
care.</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> If you loved me, you would not take all occasions to leave me
thus.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Do, go to Kent, and when you come again, here they
are ready for you.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Shews the paper.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> What's that you have in your hand there, sirrah?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Pox, what ill luck was this! what shall I say?</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Sometimes you have tongue enough; what, are you silent?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> 'Tis an account, sir, of what money you have lost since you came
to town.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> I am very glad on't: Now I'll make you all see the severity
of my fortune&mdash;&mdash;give me the paper.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Heaven! what does he mean to do? It is not fair writ out, sir.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Besides, I am in haste; another time, sir&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Pray, oblige me, sir; 'tis but one minute: All people love
to be pitied in their misfortunes, and so do I: will you produce it,
sirrah?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Dear master!</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Dear rascal! am I master, or you, you rogue?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Hold yet, sir, and let me read it: You cannot read my hand.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> This is ever his way to be disparaging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[45]</a></span> me; but I'll let you
see, sirrah, that I can read your hand better than you yourself can.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> You'll repent it; there's a trick in't, sir.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Is there so, sirrah? but I'll bring you out of all your
tricks with a vengeance to you&mdash;&mdash;[<i>Reads.</i>] How now! What's this? A
true particular of the estate of Sir John Swallow, knight, lying and
situate in, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> This is the very paper I had lost: I'm very glad on't;
[<i>Takes the paper.</i>] it has saved me a most unwelcome journey&mdash;but I
will not thank you for the courtesy, which now I find you never did
intend me&mdash;this is confederacy, I smoke it now&mdash;come, madam, let me wait
on you to your father.</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> Well, of a witty man, this was the foolishest part that ever I
beheld.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exeunt Sir</i> <span class="smcap">John</span>, <span class="smcap">Millisent</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Rose.</span></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> I am a fool, I must confess it; and I am the most miserable
one without thy help&mdash;but yet it was such a mistake as any man might
have made.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> No doubt of it.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Pr'ythee chide me! this indifference of thine wounds me to
the heart.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> I care not.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Wilt thou not help me for this once?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Sir, I kiss your hands, I have other business.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Dear Warner!</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> I am inflexible.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Then I am resolved I'll kill myself.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> You are master of your own body.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Will you let me damn my soul?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> At your pleasure, as the devil and you can agree about it.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[46]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> D'ye see, the point's ready? Will you do nothing to save my
life?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Not in the least.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Farewell, hard-hearted Warner.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Adieu, soft-headed Sir Martin.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Is it possible?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Why don't you despatch, sir? why all these preambles?</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> I'll see thee hanged first: I know thou wouldst have me
killed, to get my clothes.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> I knew it was but a copy of your countenance; people in this age
are not so apt to kill themselves.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Here are yet ten pieces in my pocket; take 'em, and let's be
friends.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> You know the easiness of my nature, and that makes you work upon
it so. Well, sir, for this once I cast an eye of pity on you; but I must
have ten more in hand, before I can stir a foot.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> As I am a true gamester, I have lost all but these; but if
thou'lt lend me them, I'll give 'em thee again.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> But why so soon, and in private?<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[47]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> It strikes to my heart already; in fine, I am a dead man.
Warner&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Well, go your ways, I'll try what may be done. Look if he will
stir now; your rival and the old man will see us together; we are just
below the window.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Thou canst not do it.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> On the peril of my twenty pieces be it.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> But I have found a way to help thee out; trust to my wit but
once.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> A trifle, just nothing.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> That's very strange.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> It was for telling him he lost too much at play: I meant him
nothing but well, heaven knows; and he, in a cursed damned humour, would
needs revenge his losses upon me: and kicked me, took away my money, and
turned me off; but, if I take it at his hands,&mdash;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[48]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mood.</i> By cox-nowns, it was an ill-natured part; nay, I thought no
better would come on't, when I heard him at his vow to gads, and in
fines.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> But, if I live, I'll cry quittance with him: he had engaged me
to get Mrs Millisent, your daughter, for him; but if I do not all I can
to make her hate him! a great booby, an overgrown oaf, a conceited
Bartlemew&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Pr'ythee leave off thy choler, and hear me a little: I have
had a great mind to thee a long time; if thou thinkest my service better
than his, from this minute I entertain thee.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> With all my heart, sir; and so much the rather, that I might
spite him with it. This was the most propitious fate&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mood.</i> Propitious! and fate! what a damned scanderbag rogue art thou,
to talk at this rate? Hark you, sirrah, one word more of this gibberish,
and I'll set you packing from your new service: I'll have neither
propitious nor fate come within my doors.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Nay, pray, father&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Good old sir, be pacified; I was pouring out a little of the
dregs that I had left in me of my former service, and now they are gone,
my stomach's clear of them.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> This fellow is come in a happy hour; for now, sir, you and I
may go to prepare the licence, and, in the mean time, he may have an eye
upon your daughter.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> If you please I'll wait upon her till she's ready, and then
bring her to what church you shall appoint.</p>

<p><i>Mood.</i> But, friend, you'll find she'll hang an arse, and be very loath
to come along with you, and therefore I had best stay behind and bring
her myself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[49]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> I warrant you I have a trick for that, sir: She knows nothing of
my being turned away; so I'll come to her as from Sir Martin, and, under
pretence of carrying her to him, conduct her to you.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> My better angel&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mood.</i> By the mass, 'twas well thought on; well, son, go you before,
I'll speak but one word for a dish or two at dinner, and follow you to
the licence office. Sirrah, stay you here, till my return.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exeunt Sir</i> <span class="smcap">John</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Moody</span>.</span><br /></p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Was there ever such a lucky rogue as I? I had always a good
opinion of my wit, but could never think I had so much as now I find. I
have now gained an opportunity to carry away Mrs Millisent, for my
master to get his mistress by means of his rival, to receive all his
happiness, where he could expect nothing but misery: After this exploit,
I will have Lilly draw me in the habit of a hero, with a laurel on my
temples, and an inscription below it; <i>This is Warner, the flower of
serving-men.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter Messenger.</i></p>

<p><i>Mess.</i> Pray do me the favour to help me to the speech of Mr Moody.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> What's your business?</p>

<p><i>Mess.</i> I have a letter to deliver to him.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Here he comes, you may deliver it yourself to him.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Moody</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mess.</i> Sir, a gentleman met me at the corner of the next street, and
bid me give this into your own hands.</p>

<p><i>Mood.</i> Stay, friend, till I have read it.</p>

<p><i>Mess.</i> He told me, sir, it required no answer.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exit Mess.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Mood. reads. <i>Sir, permit me, though a stranger, to give you counsel;
some young gallants have had intelligence, that this day you intend
privately to marry your daughter, the rich heiress; and, in fine, above
twenty of them have dispersed themselves to watch her going out:
Therefore, put it off, if you will avoid mischief, and be advised by</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;"><i>Your unknown servant</i>.</span></p>

<p><i>Mood.</i> By the mackings, I thought there was no good in't, when I saw
<i>in fine</i> there; there are some Papishes, I'll warrant, that lie in wait
for my daughter; or else they are no Englishmen, but some of your French
Outalian-rogues; I owe him thanks, however, this unknown friend of mine,
that told me on't. Warner, no wedding to-day, Warner.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Why, what's the matter, sir?</p>

<p><i>Mood.</i> I say no more, but some wiser than some; I'll keep my daughter
at home this afternoon, and a fig for all these Outalians.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Moody</span>.</span><br /></p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> So, here's another trick of fortune, as unexpected for bad, as
the other was for good. Nothing vexes me, but that I had made my game
cock-sure, and then to be back-gammoned: It must needs be the devil that
writ this letter; he owed my master a spite, and has paid him to the
purpose: And here he comes as merry too! he little thinks what
misfortune has befallen him; and, for my part, I am ashamed to tell him.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter Sir</i> <span class="smcap">Martin</span><i>laughing</i>.<br /></p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Warner, such a jest, Warner!<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Laughs again.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> What a murrain is the matter, sir? Where
lies this jest that tickles you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[51]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Let me laugh out my laugh, and I'll
tell thee.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Laughs again.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> I wish you may have cause for all this mirth.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Hereafter, Warner, be it known unto thee, I will endure no
more to be thy May-game: Thou shalt no more dare to tell me, I spoil thy
projects, and discover thy designs; for I have played such a prize,
without thy help, of my own mother-wit, ('tis true I am hasty sometimes,
and so do harm; but when I have a mind to shew myself, there's no man in
England, though I say't, comes near me as to point of imagination) I'll
make thee acknowledge I have laid a plot that has a soul in't.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Pray, sir, keep me no longer in ignorance of this rare
invention.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Know then, Warner, that, when I left thee, I was possessed
with a terrible fear, that my mistress should be married: Well, thought
I to myself,&mdash;and mustering up all the forces of my wit, I did
produce such a stratagem!</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> But what was it?</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> I feigned a letter as from an unknown friend to Moody,
wherein I gave him to understand, that if his daughter went out this
afternoon, she would infallibly be snapped by some young fellows that
lay in wait for her.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Very good.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> That which follows is yet better; for he I sent assures me,
that in that very nick of time my letter came, her father was just
sending her abroad with a very foolish rascally fellow, that was with
him.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> And did you perform all this, a'God's name? Could you do this
wonderful miracle without giving your soul to the devil for his help?</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> I tell thee, man, I did it; and it was done by the help of
no devil, but this familiar of my own brain; how long would it have been
ere thou couldst have thought of such a project? Martin said to his
man, <i>Who's the fool now?</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[52]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Who's the fool! why, who uses to be the fool? he that ever was
since I knew him, and ever will be so.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> What a pox! I think thou art grown envious; not one word in
my commendation?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Faith, sir, my skill is too little to praise you as you deserve;
but if you would have it according to my poor ability, you are one that
had a knock in your cradle, a conceited lack-wit, a designing ass, a
hair-brained fop, a confounded busy-brain, with an eternal windmill in
it; this, in short, sir, is the contents of your panegyric.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> But what the devil have I done, to set you thus against me?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Only this, sir: I was the foolish rascally fellow that was with
Moody, and your worship was he to whom I was to bring his daughter.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> But how could I know this? I am no witch.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> No, I'll be sworn for you, you are no conjurer. Will you go,
sir?</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Will you hear my justification?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Shall I see the back of you? speak not a word in your defence.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Shoves him.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> This is the strangest luck now&mdash;&mdash;<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exit.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> I'm resolved this devil of his shall never weary me; I will
overcome him, I will invent something that shall stand good in spite of
his folly. Let me see&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter Lord.</i></p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> Here he is&mdash;I must venture on him, for the tyranny of this
old lady is unsupportable; since I have made her my confident, there
passes not an hour, but she passes a pull at my purse-strings; I shall
be ruined if I do not quit myself of her suddenly: I find, now, by sad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[53]</a></span>
experience, that a mistress is much more chargeable than a wife, and
after a little time too, grows full as dull and insignificant.&mdash;Mr
Warner! have you a mind to do yourself a courtesy, and me another?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> I think, my lord, the question need not be much disputed, for I
have always had a great service for your lordship, and some little
kindness for myself.</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> What if you should propose mistress Christian as a wife to your
master? You know he's never like to compass t'other.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> I cannot tell that, my lord.</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> Five hundred pounds are yours at the day of marriage.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Five hundred pounds! 'tis true, the temptation is very sweet and
powerful; the devil, I confess, has done his part, and many a good
murder and treason have been committed at a cheaper rate; but
yet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> What yet?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> To confess the truth, I am resolved to bestow my master upon
that other lady (as difficult as your lordship thinks it), for the
honour of my wit is engaged in it: Will it not be the same to your
lordship, were she married to any other?</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> The very same.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Come, my lord, not to dissemble with you any longer, I know
where it is that your shoe wrings you: I have observed something in the
house, betwixt some parties that shall be nameless: And know, that you
have been taking up linen at a much dearer rate, than you might have had
it in any draper's in town.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[54]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> I see I have not danced in a net before you.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> As for that old lady, whom hell confound, she is the greatest
jilt in nature; cheat is her study; all her joy to cozen; she loves
nothing but herself; and draws all lines to that corrupted centre.</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> I have found her out, though late: First, I'll undertake I ne'er
enjoyed her niece under the rate of five hundred pounds a-time; never
was woman's flesh held up so high: Every night I find out for a new
maidenhead, and she has sold it me as often as ever Mother Temple,
Bennet, or Gifford, have put off boiled capons for quails and
partridges.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> This is nothing to what bills you'll have when she's brought to
bed, after her hard bargain, as they call it; then crammed capons,
pea-hens, chickens in the grease, pottages, and fricasees, wine from
Shatling, and La-fronds, with New River, clearer by sixpence the pound
than ever God Almighty made it; then midwife&mdash;dry nurse&mdash;wet
nurse&mdash;and all the rest of their accomplices, with cradle,
baby-clouts, and bearing-clothes&mdash;possets, caudles, broths,
jellies, and gravies; and behind all these, glisters, suppositers, and a
barbarous apothecary's bill, more inhuman than a tailor's.</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> I sweat to think on't.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Well, my lord, cheer up! I have found a way to rid you of it
all; within a short time you shall know more; yonder appears a young
lady, whom I must needs speak with; please you go in, and prepare the
old lady and your mistress.</p>

Martin; a plot of his, upon my life, to hinder our marriage.</p>

deceived, if that letter came not from another hand.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> From whom, I pr'ythee?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Nay, for that you shall excuse me, sir; I do not love to make a
breach between persons, that are to be so near related.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Thou seemest to imply, that my mistress was in the plot.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Can you make a doubt on't? Do you not know she ever loved him,
and can you hope she has so soon forsaken him? You may make yourself
miserable, if you please, by such a marriage.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Yes, in my conscience is she; for Sir Martin's tongue's no
slander.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> But does he say to the contrary?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> If one would believe him,&mdash;which, for my part, I do
not,&mdash;he has in a manner confessed it to me.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Hell and damnation!</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Courage, sir, never vex yourself; I'll warrant you 'tis all a
lie.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> But, how shall I be sure 'tis so?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> When you are married, you'll soon make trial, whether she be a
maid or no.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> I do not love to make that experiment at my own cost.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Then you must never marry.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Ay, but they have so many tricks to cheat a man, which are
entailed from mother to daughter through all generations; there's no
keeping a lock for that door, for which every one has a key.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> As, for example, their drawing up their breaths, with&mdash;oh!
you hurt me, can you be so cruel? then, the next day, she steals a visit
to her lover, that did you the courtesy beforehand, and in private tells
him how she cozened you; twenty to one but she takes out another lesson
with him, to practise the next night.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> All this while, miserable I must be their May-game!</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> 'Tis well, if you escape so; for commonly he strikes in with
you, and becomes your friend.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Deliver me from such a friend, that stays behind with my
wife, when I gird on my sword to go abroad.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Ay, there's your man, sir; besides, he will be sure to watch
your haunts, and tell her of them, that, if occasion be, she may have
wherewithal to recriminate: at least she will seem to be jealous of you;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[59]</a></span>
and who would suspect a jealous wife?</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> All manner of ways I am most miserable.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> But, if she be not a maid when you marry her, she may make a
good wife afterwards; 'tis but imagining you have taken such a man's
widow.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> If that were all; but the man will come and claim her again.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Examples have been frequent of those that have been wanton, and
yet afterwards take up.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Ay, the same thing they took up before.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> The truth is, an honest simple girl, that's ignorant of all
things, maketh the best matrimony: There is such pleasure in instructing
her; the best is, there's not one dunce in all the sex; such a one with
a good fortune&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Ay, but where is she, Warner?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Near enough, but that you are too far engaged.</p>

five thousand pounds, and a better penny.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Ay, but is she fool enough?</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Dear Warner, step into the next room, and inveigle her out
this way, that I may speak to her.</p>

like a colt that never yet was backed; for so I shall make her what I
list, and mould her as I will. Lord! her innocence makes me laugh my
cheeks all wet. [<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;Sweet lady&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> I'm but a gentlewoman, forsooth.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Well then, sweet mistress, if I get your friends' consent,
shall I have yours?</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> My old lady may do what she will, forsooth; but by my truly, I
hope she will have more care of me, than to marry me yet. Lord bless me,
what should I do with a husband?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[61]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Well, sweetheart, then instead of wooing you, I must woo my
old lady.</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> Indeed, gentleman, my old lady is married already: Cry you mercy,
forsooth, I think you are a knight.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Happy in that title, only to make you a lady.</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> Believe me, Mr Knight, I would not be a lady; it makes folks
proud, and so humorous, and so ill huswifes, forsooth.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Pah!&mdash;she's a baby, the simplest thing that ever yet I
knew: the happiest man I shall be in the world; for should I have my
wish, it should be to keep school, and teach the bigger girls, and here,
in one, my wish it is absolved.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter Lady</i> <span class="smcap">Dupe</span>.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> By your leave, sir: I hope this noble knight will make you
happy, and you make him&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> What should I make him?<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Sighing.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> Marry, you shall make him happy in a good wife.</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> I will not marry, madam.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> You fool!</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Pray, madam, let me speak with you; on my soul, 'tis the
prettiest innocentest thing in the world.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> Indeed, sir, she knows little besides her work, and her
prayers; but I'll talk with the fool.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Deal gently with her, dear madam.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> Come, Christian, will you not marry this noble knight?</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> Ye&mdash;ye&mdash;yes&mdash;&mdash;<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Sobbingly.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> Sir, it shall be to night.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> You are very melancholy, methinks, sir.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> You are mistaken, sir.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> You may dissemble as you please, but Mrs Millisent lies at
the bottom of your heart.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> My heart, I assure you, has no room for so poor a trifle.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Sure you think to wheedle me; would you have me imagine you
do not love her?</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Love her! why should you think me such a sot? love a
prostitute, an infamous person!</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Fair and soft, good Sir John.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> You see, I am no very obstinate rival, I leave the field
free to you: Go on, sir, and pursue your good fortune, and be as happy
as such a common creature can make thee.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> This is Hebrew-Greek to me; but I must tell you, sir, I will
not suffer my divinity to be prophaned by such a tongue as yours.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Believe it; whate'er I say, I can quote my author for.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Then, sir, whoever told it you, lied in his throat, d'ye
see, and deeper than that, d'ye see, in his stomach, and his guts, d'ye
see: Tell me she's a common person! he's a son of a whore that said it,
and I'll make him eat his words, though he spoke 'em in a privy-house.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> What if Warner told me so? I hope
you'll grant him to be a competent judge in such a business.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Did that precious rascal say it?&mdash;Now I think on't,
I'll not believe you: In fine, sir, I'll hold you an even wager he
denies it.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> I'll lay you ten to one, he justifies it to your face.<span class="pagenum"><a

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> I'll make him give up the ghost under my fist, if he does
not deny it.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> I'll cut off his ears upon the spot, if he does not stand
to't.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Warner</span>.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Here he comes, in pudding-time, to resolve the
question:&mdash;Come hither, you lying varlet, hold up your hand at the
bar of justice, and answer me to what I shall demand.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> What-a-goodjer is the matter, sir?</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Thou spawn of the old serpent, fruitful in nothing but in
lies!</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> A very fair beginning this.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Didst thou dare to cast thy venom upon such a saint as Mrs
Millisent, to traduce her virtue, and say it was adulterate?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Not guilty, my lord.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> I told you so.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> How, Mr Rascal! have you forgot what you said but now
concerning Sir Martin and Mrs Millisent? I'll stop the lie down your
throat, if you dare deny it.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Say you so! are you there again, i'faith?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Pray pacify yourself, sir; 'twas a plot of my own devising.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside</i>.</span><br /></p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Leave off your winking and your pinking, with a hose-pox
t'ye. I'll understand none of it; tell me in plain English the truth of
the business; for an you were my own brother, you should pay for it:
Belie my mistress! what a pox, d'ye think I have no sense of honour?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> What the devil's the matter w'ye? Either be at quiet, or I'll
resolve to take my heels, and begone.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Stop thief, there! what, did you think to 'scape the hand of
justice? [<i>Lays hold on him.</i>] The best on't is, sirrah, your heels are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[64]</a></span>
not altogether so nimble as your tongue.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Beats him.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Help! Murder! Murder!</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Hold your hands, I think the devil's in you,&mdash;I tell you
'tis a device of mine.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> And have you no body to devise it on but my mistress, the
very map of innocence?</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Moderate your anger, good Sir Martin.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> By your patience, sir, I'll chastise him abundantly.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> That's a little too much, sir, by your favour, to beat him
in my presence.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> That's a good one, i'faith; your presence shall hinder me
from beating my own servant?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> O traitor to all sense and reason! he's going to discover that
too.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> An I had a mind to beat him to mummy, he's my own, I hope.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> At present, I must tell you, he's mine, sir.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Hey-day! here's fine juggling!</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Stop yet, sir, you are just upon the brink of a precipice.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> What is't thou mean'st now?&mdash;O Lord! my mind misgives
me, I have done some fault; but would I were hanged if I can find it
out.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> There's no making him understand me.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Pox on't, come what will, I'll not be faced down with a lie;
I say, he is my man.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Pray remember yourself better; did not you turn him away for
some fault lately, and laid a livery of black and blue on his back,
before he went?</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> The devil of any fault, or any black and blue, that I
remember: Either the rascal put some trick upon you, or you would upon
me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[65]</a></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> O ho, then it seems the cudgelling and turning away were
pure invention; I am glad I understand it.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> In fine, its all so damned a lie&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Alas! he has forgot it, sir; good wits, you know, have bad
memories.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> No, no, sir, that shall not serve your turn; you may return
when you please to your old master; I give you a fair discharge, and a
glad man I am to be so rid of you: Were you thereabouts, i'faith? What a
snake I had entertained in my bosom! Fare you well, sir, and lay your
next plot better between you, I advise you.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exit Sir</i> <span class="smcap">John</span>.</span><br /></p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Lord, sir, how you stand, as you were nipped i'the head! Have
you done any new piece of folly, that makes you look so like an ass?</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Here's three pieces of gold yet, if I had the heart to offer
it thee.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Holds the gold afar off, trembling.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Noble sir, what have I done to deserve so great a liberality? I
confess, if you had beaten me for my own fault, if you had utterly
destroyed all my projects, then it might have been expected, that ten or
twenty pieces should have been offered by way of recompence or
satisfaction.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Nay, an you be so full of your flouts, your friend and
servant; who the devil could tell the meaning of your signs and tokens,
an you go to that?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> You are no ass then?</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Well, sir, to do you service, d'ye see, I am an ass in a
fair way; will that satisfy you?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> For this once produce those three pieces; I am contented to
receive that inconsiderable tribute; or make 'em six, and I'll take the
fault upon myself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[66]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Are we friends then? If we are, let me advise
you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Yet advising!</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> For no harm, good Warner: But pray next time make me of your
council, let me enter into the business, instruct me in every point, and
then if I discover all, I am resolved to give over affairs, and retire
from the world.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Agreed, it shall be so; but let us now take breath a while, then
on again. take breath a while, then on again.</p>

<h3>ACT V. SCENE I.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Enter Lord, Lady</i> <span class="smcap">Dupe</span>, <i>Mistress</i> <span class="smcap">Christian</span>,
<span class="smcap">Rose</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Warner</span>.</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> Your promise is admirably made good to me, that Sir John Swallow
should be this night married to Mrs Christian; instead of that, he is
more deeply engaged than ever with old Moody.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> I cannot help those ebbs and flows of fortune.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe</i>. I am sure my niece suffers most in't; he's come off to her
with a cold compliment of a mistake in his mistress's virtue, which he
has now found out, by your master's folly, to be a plot of yours to
separate them.</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> To be forsaken, when a woman has given her consent!</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> 'Tis the same scorn, as to have a town rendered up, and
afterwards slighted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[67]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> You are a sweet youth, sir, to use my lady so, when she depended
on you; is this the faith of a valet de chambre? I would be ashamed to
be such a dishonour to my profession; it will reflect upon us in time;
we shall be ruined by your good example.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> As how, my dear lady embassadress?</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> Why, they say the women govern their ladies, and you govern us:
So if you play fast and loose, not a gallant will bribe us for our good
wills; the gentle guinea will now go to the ordinary, which used as duly
to steal into our hands at the stair-foot, as into Mr Doctor's at
parting.</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> Night's come, and I expect your promise.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe</i>. Fail with me if you think good, sir.</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> I give no more time.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> And if my mistress go to bed a maid to-night&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Hey-day! you are dealing with me, as they do with the bankrupts,
call in all your debts together; there's no possibility of payment at
this rate, but I'll coin for you all as fast as I can, I assure you.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> But you must not think to pay us with false money, as you
have done hitherto.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> Leave off your mountebank tricks with us, and fall to your
business in good earnest.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Faith, and I will, Rose; for, to confess the truth, I am a kind
of mountebank; I have but one cure for all your diseases, that is, that
my master may marry Mrs Millisent, for then Sir John Swallow will of
himself return to Mrs Christian.</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> He says true, and therefore we must all be helping to that
design.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> I'll put you upon something, give me but a thinking time. In the
first place, get a warrant and bailiffs to arrest Sir John Swallow upon
a promise of marriage to Mrs Christian.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[68]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> Very good.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> We'll all swear it.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> I never doubted your ladyship in the least, madam&mdash;for the
rest we will consider hereafter.</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> Leave this to us.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Ex. Lord, Lady</i> <span class="smcap">Dupe</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Chr</span>.</span><br /></p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Rose, where's thy lady?</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> [<i>above.</i>] What have you to say to her?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Only to tell you, madam, I am going forward in the great work of
projection.</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> I know not whether you will deserve my thanks when the work's
done.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Madam, I hope you are not become indifferent to my master?</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> If he should prove a fool, after all your crying up his wit, I
shall be a miserable woman.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> A fool! that were a good jest, i'faith: but how comes your
ladyship to suspect it?</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> I have heard, madam, your greatest wits have ever a touch of
madness and extravagance in them, so perhaps has he.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> There's nothing more distant than wit and folly; yet, like east
and west, they may meet in a point, and produce actions that are but a
hair's breadth from one another.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> I'll undertake he has wit enough to make one laugh at him a
whole day together: He's a most comical person.</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> For all this, I will not swear he is no fool; he has still
discovered all your plots.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> O, madam, that's the common fate of your Machiavelians; they
draw their designs so subtle, that their very fineness breaks
them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[69]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> However, I'm resolved to be on the sure side: I will have
certain proof of his wit, before I marry him.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Madam, I'll give you one; he wears his clothes like a great
sloven, and that's a sure sign of wit; he neglects his outward parts;
besides, he speaks French, sings, dances, plays upon the lute.</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> Does he do all this, say you?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Most divinely, madam.</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> I ask no more; then let him give me a serenade immediately; but
let him stand in view, I'll not be cheated.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> He shall do't, madam:&mdash;-But how, the devil knows; for he
sings like a screech-owl, and never touched the lute.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> You'll see't performed?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Now I think on't, madam, this will but retard our enterprise.</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> Either let him do't, or see me no more.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Well, it shall be done, madam; but where's your father? will not
he overhear it?</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> As good hap is, he's below stairs, talking with a seaman, that
has brought him news from the East Indies.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> What concernment can he have there?</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> He had a bastard son there, whom he loved extremely: but not
having any news from him these many years, concluded him dead; this son
he expects within these three days.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> When did he see him last?</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> Not since he was seven years old.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> A sudden thought comes into my head, to make him appear before
his time; let my master pass for him, and by that means he may come into
the house unsuspected by your father, or his rival.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[70]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> According as he performs his serenade, I'll talk with
you&mdash;&mdash;make haste&mdash;&mdash;I must retire a little.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exit</i><span class="smcap">Mill</span>. <i>from above</i>.</span><br /></p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> I'll instruct him most rarely, he shall never be found out; but,
in the mean time, what wilt thou do for a serenade?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Faith, I am a little non-plus'd on the sudden; but a warm
consolation from thy lips, Rose, would set my wits a working again.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> Adieu, Warner.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exit.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Inhuman Rose, adieu!&mdash;Blockhead Warner, into what a
premunire hast thou brought thyself; this 'tis to be so forward to
promise for another;&mdash;but to be godfather to a fool, to promise and
vow he should do any thing like a Christian&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter Sir</i> <span class="smcap">Martin Mar-all</span>.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Why, how now, bully, in a brown study? For my good, I
warrant it; there's five shillings for thee. What! we must encourage
good wits sometimes.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Hang your white pelf: Sure, sir, by your largess, you mistake me
for Martin Parker, the ballad-maker; your covetousness has offended my
muse, and quite dulled her.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> How angry the poor devil is! In fine, thou art as choleric
as a cook by a fireside.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> I am overheated, like a gun, with continual discharging my wit:
'Slife, sir, I have rarified my brains for you, 'till they are
evaporated; but come, sir, do something for yourself like a man: I have
engaged you shall give to your mistress a serenade in your proper
person: I'll borrow a lute for you.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> I'll warrant thee I'll do't, man.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> You never learned: I do not think you know one stop.<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[71]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> 'Tis no matter for that, sir; I'll play as fast as I can,
and never stop at all.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Go to, you are an invincible fool, I see. Get up into your
window, and set two candles by you; take my landlord's lute in your
hand, and fumble on it, and make grimaces with your mouth, as if you
sung; in the mean time, I'll play in the next room in the dark, and
consequently your mistress, who will come to her balcony over against
you, will think it to be you; and at the end of every tune, I'll ring
the bell that hangs between your chamber and mine, that you may know
when to have done.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Why, this is fair play now, to tell a man beforehand what he
must do; gramercy, i'faith, boy, now if I fail thee&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> About your business, then, your mistress and her maid appear
already: I'll give you the sign with the bell when I am prepared, for my
lute is at hand in the barber's shop.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exeunt.</i></span><br /></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter Mrs</i> <span class="smcap">Millisent</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Rose</span>, <i>with a candle by<br /> them, above</i>.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> We shall have rare music.</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> I wish it prove so; for I suspect the knight can neither play
nor sing.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> But if he does, you are bound to pay the music, madam.</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> I'll not believe it, except both my ears and eyes are witnesses.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> But 'tis night, madam, and you cannot see him; yet he may play
admirably in the dark.</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> Where's my father?</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> You need not fear him, he's still employed with that same
seaman; and I have set Mrs Christian to watch their discourse, that,
betwixt her and me, Warner may have wherewithal to instruct his
master.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[72]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> But yet there's fear my father will find out the plot.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> Not in the least; for my old lady has provided two rare
disguises for the master and the man.</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> Peace, I hear them beginning to tune the lute.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> And see, madam, where your true knight,
Sir Martin, is placed yonder like Apollo, with his
lute in his hand, and his rays about his head. [<span class="smcap">Sir
Martin</span> <i>appears at the adverse window; a tune is played;
when it is done</i>, <span class="smcap">Warner</span> <i>rings, and</i> <span class="smcap">Sir Martin</span>

<p><i>Mill.</i> He played well, and yet methinks he held
his lute but untowardly.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> Dear madam, peace; now for the song.</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> A pretty humoured song. But stay, methinks he plays and sings
still, and yet we cannot hear him. Play louder, Sir Martin, that we may
have the fruits on't.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> [<i>Peeping</i>.] Death! this abominable fool will spoil all
again. Damn him, he stands making his grimaces yonder; and he looks so
earnestly upon his mistress, that he hears me not.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Rings again.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> Ah, ah! have I found you out, sir? Now, as I live and breathe,
this is pleasant: Rose, his man played and sung for him, and he, it
seems, did not know when he should give over.<br />

<p><i>Warn.</i> They have found him out, and laugh yonder, as if they would
split their sides. Why, Mr Fool, Oaf, Coxcomb, will you hear none of
your names?</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> Sir Martin, Sir Martin, take your man's counsel, and keep time
with your music.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> [<i>Peeping.</i>] Hah! What do you say, madam? How does your
ladyship like my music?</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> O most heavenly! just like the harmony of the spheres, that is
to be admired, and never heard.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> You have ruined all, by your not leaving off in time.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> What the devil would you have a man do, when my hand is in!
Well, o'my conscience, I think there is a fate upon me.<br />

<p><i>Mill.</i> Look, Rose, what's the matter.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> 'Tis Sir John Swallow pursued by the bailiffs, madam, according

Dear Sir Martin, a goodnight.</p>

you.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Ay, just as much as you did e'en now with your music; go, you
are so beastly a fool, that a chiding is thrown away upon you.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Fool in your face, sir; call a man of honour fool, when I
have just achieved such an enterprise&mdash;Gad, now my blood's up, I am
a dangerous person, I can tell you that, Warner.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Poor animal, I pity thee!</p>

a swordsman: I have beat them bravely; and, in fine, I am come off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[76]</a></span>
unhurt, save only a little scratch in the head.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> That's impossible; thou hast a skull so thick, no sword can
pierce it; but much good may it do you, sir, with the fruits of your
valour: You rescued your rival, when he was to be arrested, on purpose
to take him off from your mistress.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Why, this is ever the fate of ingenious men; nothing thrives
they take in hand.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Rose</span>.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> Sir Martin, you have done your business with my lady, she'll
never look upon you more; she says, she's so well satisfied of your wit
and courage, that she will not put you to any further trial.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Warner, is there no hopes, Warner?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> None that I know.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Let's have but one civil plot more before we part.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> 'Tis to no purpose.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> Yet, if he had some golden friends, that would engage for him
the next time&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Here's a Jacobus and a Carolus will enter into bonds for me.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> I'll take their royal words for once.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>She fetches two disguises.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> The meaning of this, dear Rose?</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> 'Tis in pursuance of thy own invention, Warner; a child which
thy wit hath begot upon me: But let us lose no time. Help! help! dress
thy master, that he may be Anthony, old Moody's bastard, and thou his,
come from the East Indies.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Hey-tarock it&mdash;now we shall have Rose's device too; I
long to be at it, pray let's hear more on it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[77]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> Old Moody, you must know, in his younger years, when he was a
Cambridge-scholar, made bold with a townsman's daughter there, by whom
he had a bastard, whose name was Anthony, whom you, Sir Martin, are to
represent.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> I warrant you; let me alone for Tony: But pray go on, Rose.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> This child, in his father's time, he durst not own, but bred him
privately in the isle of Ely, till he was seven years old, and from
thence sent him with one Bonaventure, a merchant, for the East Indies.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> But will not this over-burden your memory, sir?</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> There's no answering thee any thing; thou thinkest I am good
for nothing.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> Bonaventure died at Surat within two years, and this Anthony has
lived up and down in the Mogul's country, unheard of by his father till
this night, and is expected within these three days: Now if you can pass
for him, you may have admittance into the house, and make an end of all
the business before the other Anthony arrives.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> But hold, Rose, there's one considerable point omitted; what was
his mother's name?</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> That indeed I had forgot; her name was Dorothy, daughter to one
Draw-water, a vintner at the Rose.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Come, sir, are you perfect in your lesson? Anthony Moody, born
in Cambridge, bred in the isle of Ely, sent into the Mogul's country at
seven years old, with one Bonaventure, a merchant, who died within two
years; your mother's name Dorothy Draw-water, the vintner's daughter at
the Rose.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> I have it all <i>ad unguem</i>&mdash;what! do'st think I'm a sot?
But stay a little,&mdash;&mdash;how have I lived all this while in that
same country?<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[78]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> What country?&mdash;Pox, he has forgot already!</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> The Mogul's country.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Ay, ay, the Mogul's country. What the devil, any man may
mistake a little; but now I have it perfect: But what have I been doing
all this while in the Mogul's country?&mdash;He's a heathen rogue, I am
afraid I shall never hit upon his name.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Why, you have been passing your time there no matter how.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> Well, if this passes upon the old man, I'll bring your business
about again with my mistress, never fear it; stay you here at the door,
I'll go tell the old man of your arrival.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Well, sir, now play your part exactly, and I'll forgive all your
former errors.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Hang them, they were only slips of youth. How peremptory and
domineering this rogue is, now he sees I have need of his service! Would
I were out of his power again, I would make him lie at my feet like any
spaniel.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Moody</span>, <i>Sir</i> <span class="smcap">John</span>, <i>Lord</i>, <i>Lady</i> <span class="smcap">Dupe, Millisent, Christian</span>,

<p><i>Mood.</i> Is he here already, say'st thou? Which is he?</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> That sun-burned gentleman.</p>

<p><i>Mood.</i> My dear boy, Anthony, do I see thee again before I die? Welcome,
welcome.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> My dear father, I know it is you by instinct; for, methinks,
I am as like you, as if I were spit out of your mouth.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> Keep it up, I beseech your lordship.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside to the Lord.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> He's wonderous like indeed.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> The very image of him.</p>

<p><i>Mood.</i> Anthony, you must salute all this company: This is my Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[79]</a></span>
Dartmouth, this my Lady Dupe, this her niece Mrs Christian.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>He salutes them.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> And that's my sister; methinks I have a good resemblance of
her too: Honest sister, I must needs kiss you, sister.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> This fool will discover himself; I foresee it already by his
carriage to her.</p>

<p><i>Mood.</i> And now, Anthony, pray tell us a little of your travels.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Time enough for that, forsooth, father; but I have such a
natural affection for my sister, that, methinks, I could live and die
with her: Give me thy hand, sweet sister.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> She's beholden to you, sir.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> What if she be, sir? what's that to you, sir?</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> I hope, sir, I have not offended you?</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> It may be you have, and it may be you have not, sir; you see
I have no mind to satisfy you, sir: What a devil! a man cannot talk a
little to his own flesh and blood, but you must be interposing, with a
murrain to you.</p>

<p><i>Mood.</i> Enough of this, good Anthony; this gentleman is to marry your
sister.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> He marry my sister! Ods foot, sir, there are some bastards,
that shall be nameless, that are as well worthy to marry her, as any
man; and have as good blood in their veins.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> I do not question it in the least, sir.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> 'Tis not your best course, sir; you marry my sister! what
have you seen of the world, sir? I have seen your hurricanos, and your
calentures, and your ecliptics, and your tropic lines, sir, an you go to
that, sir.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> You must excuse my master; the sea's a little working in his
brain, sir.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[80]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sir Mart</i>. And your Prester Johns of the East Indies, and your great
Turk of Rome and Persia.</p>

<p><i>Mood.</i> Lord, what a thing it is to be learned, and a traveller!
Bodikin, it makes me weep for joy; but, Anthony, you must not bear
yourself too much upon your learning, child.</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> Pray, brother, be civil to this gentleman for my sake.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> For your sake, sister Millisent, much may be done, and here
I kiss your hand on it.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Yet again, stupidity?</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> Nay, pray, brother, hands off; now you are too rude.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Dear sister, as I am a true East India
gentleman&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mood.</i> But pray, son Anthony, let us talk of other matters; and tell me
truly, had you not quite forgot me? And yet I made woundy much of you,
when you were young.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> I remember you as well as if I saw you but yesterday: A fine
grey-headed&mdash;grey-bearded old gentleman, as ever I saw in all my
life.</p>

<p><i>Warn. aside.</i>] Grey-bearded old gentleman! when he was a scholar at
Cambridge!</p>

<p><i>Mood.</i> But do you remember where you were bred up?</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> O yes, sir, most perfectly, in the isle&mdash;stay&mdash;let
me see, oh&mdash;now I have it&mdash;in the isle of Scilly.</p>

<p><i>Mood.</i> In the Isle of Ely, sure you mean?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Without doubt, he did, sir; but this damn'd isle of Scilly runs
in his head, ever since his sea voyage.</p>

<p><i>Mood.</i> And your mother's name was&mdash;come, pray let me examine
you&mdash;for that, I'm sure, you cannot forget.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Warner! what was it, Warner?<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Poor Mrs Dorothy Draw-water, if she were now alive, what a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[81]</a></span>
joyful day would this be to her!</p>

<p><i>Mood.</i> Who the devil bid you speak, sirrah?</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Her name, sir, was Mrs Dorothy Draw-water.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> I'll be hanged if this be not some cheat.</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> He makes so many stumbles, he must needs fall at last.</p>

<p><i>Mood.</i> But you remember, I hope, where you were born?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Well, they may talk what they will of Oxford for an university,
but Cambridge for my money.</p>

<p><i>Mood.</i> Hold your tongue, you scanderbag rogue you; this is the second
time you have been talking when you should not.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> I was born at Cambridge; I remember it as perfectly as if it
were but yesterday.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> How I sweat for him! he's remembering ever since he was born.</p>

<p><i>Mood.</i> And who did you go over with to the East-Indies?</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Warner!<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> 'Twas a happy thing, sir, you lighted upon so honest a merchant
as Mr Bonaventure, to take care of him.</p>

<p><i>Mood.</i> Saucy rascal! This is past all sufferance.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> We are undone, Warner, if this discourse go on any further.</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> Pray, sir, take pity on the poor gentleman; he has more need of
a good supper, than to be asked so many questions.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> These are rogues, sir, I plainly perceive it; pray let me
ask him one question&mdash;Which way did you come home, sir?</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> We came home by land, sir.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> That is, from India to Persia, from Persia to Turkey, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[82]</a></span>
Turkey to Germany, from Germany to France.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> And from thence, over the narrow seas on horse-back.</p>

<p><i>Mood.</i> 'Tis so, I discern it now; but some shall
smoke for it. Stay a little, Anthony, I'll be with
you presently.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Mood.</span></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> That wicked old man is gone for no good,
I'm afraid; would I were fairly quit of him.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Mill. aside.</i>] Tell me no more of Sir Martin, Rose; he wants natural
sense, to talk after this rate: but for this Warner, I am strangely
taken with him; how handsomely he brought him off!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Moody</span>, <i>with two cudgels</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mood.</i> Among half a score tough cudgels I had in my chamber, I have
made choice of these two, as best able to hold out.</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> Alas! poor Warner must be beaten now, for all his wit; would I
could bear it for him!</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> But to what end is all this preparation, sir?</p>

<p><i>Mood.</i> In the first place, for your worship, and in the next, for this
East-India apostle, that will needs be my son Anthony.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Why, d'ye think he is not?</p>

<p><i>Mood.</i> No, thou wicked accomplice in his designs, I know he is not.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Who, I his accomplice? I beseech you, sir, what is it to me, if
he should prove a counterfeit? I assure you he has cozened me in the
first place.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> That's likely, i'faith, cozen his own servant!</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> As I hope for mercy, sir, I am an utter stranger to him; he
took me up but yesterday, and told me the story, word for word, as he
told it you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[83]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> What will become of us two now? I trust to the rogue's wit
to bring me off.</p>

<p><i>Mood.</i> If thou wouldst have me believe thee, take one of these two
cudgels, and help me to lay it on soundly.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> With all my heart.</p>

<p><i>Mood.</i> Out, you cheat, you hypocrite, you impostor! Do you come hither
to cozen an honest man?<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Beats him.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Hold, hold, sir!</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Do you come hither, with a lye, to get a father, Mr Anthony of
East India?</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Hold, you inhuman butcher!</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> I'll teach you to counterfeit again, sir.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> The rogue will murder me.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exit Sir</i> <span class="smcap">Mart.</span></span><br /></p>

<h3>SCENE II.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Enter again Sir</i> <span class="smcap">Martin</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Warner</span>.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Was there ever such an affront put upon a man, to be beaten
by his servant?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> After my hearty salutations upon your backside, sir, may a man
have leave to ask you, what news from the Mogul's country?</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> I wonder where thou hadst the impudence to move such a
question to me, knowing how thou hast used me.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Now, sir, you may see what comes of your indiscretion and
stupidity: I always give you warning of it; but, for this time, I am
content to pass it without more words, partly, because I have already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[84]</a></span>
corrected you, though not so much as you deserve.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Do'st thou think to carry it off at this rate, after such an
injury?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> You may thank yourself for't; nay, 'twas very well I found out
that way, otherwise I had been suspected as your accomplice.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> But you laid it on with such a vengeance, as if you were
beating of a stock-fish.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> To confess the truth on't, you had angered me, and I was willing
to evaporate my choler; if you will pass it by so, I may chance to help
you to your mistress: No more words of this business, I advise you, but
go home and grease your back.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> In fine, I must suffer it at his hands: for if my shoulders
had not paid for this fault, my purse must have sweat blood for't: The
rogue has got such a hank upon me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> So, so! here's another of our vessels come in, after the storm
that parted us.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Rose</span>.</p>

<p>What comfort, Rose? no harbour near?</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> My lady, as you may well imagine, is most extremely incensed
against Sir Martin; but she applauds your ingenuity to the skies. I'll
say no more, but thereby hangs a tale.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> I am considering with myself about a plot, to bring all
about again.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> Yet again plotting! if you have such a mind to't, I know no way
so proper for you, as to turn poet to Pugenello.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Hark! is not that music in your house?<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Music plays.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> Yes, Sir John has given my mistress the fiddles, and our old man
is as jocund yonder, and does so hug himself, to think how he has been
revenged upon you!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[85]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Why, he does not know 'twas me, I hope?</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> 'Tis all one for that.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> I have such a plot!&mdash;I care not, I will speak, an I
were to be hanged for't. Shall I speak, dear Warner? let me now; it does
so wamble within me, just like a clyster, i'faith la, and I can keep it
no longer, for my heart.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Well, I am indulgent to you; out with it boldly, in the name of
nonsense.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> We two will put on vizards, and with the help of my
landlord, who shall be of the party, go a mumming there, and by some
device of dancing, get my mistress away, unsuspected by them all.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> What if this should hit now, when all your projects have failed,
Warner?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Would I were hanged, if it be not somewhat probable: Nay, now I
consider better on't&mdash;exceedingly probable; it must take, 'tis not
in nature to be avoided.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> O must it so, sir! and who may you thank for't?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Now am I so mad he should be the author of this device! How the
devil, sir, came you to stumble on't?</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Why should not my brains be as fruitful as yours, or any
man's?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> This is so good, it shall not be your plot, sir; either disown
it, or I will proceed no further.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> I would not lose the credit of my plot, to gain my mistress:
The plot's a good one, and I'll justify it upon any ground in England;
an you will not work upon't, it shall be done without you.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> I think the knight has reason.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[86]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Well, I'll order it however to the best advantage: Hark you,
Rose.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Whispers.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> If it miscarry by your ordering, take notice, 'tis your
fault; 'tis well invented, I'll take my oath on't.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> I must into them, for fear I should be suspected; but I'll
acquaint my lord, my old lady, and all the rest, who ought to know it,
with your design.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> We'll be with you in a twinkling: You and I, Rose, are to follow
our leaders, and be paired to night.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> To have, and to hold, are dreadful words, Warner; but, for your
sake, I'll venture on 'em.<br />

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> Nay! good my lord, be patient.</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> Does he think to give fiddles and treatments in a house, where
he has wronged a lady? I'll never suffer it.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> But upon what ground will you raise your quarrel?</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> A very just one,&mdash;as I am her kinsman.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> He does not know yet why he was to be arrested; try that way
again.</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> I'll hear of nothing but revenge.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Rose</span>.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> Yes, pray hear me one word, my lord; Sir Martin himself has made
a plot.</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> That's like to be a good one.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> A fool's plot may be as lucky as a fool's handsel; 'tis a very
likely one, and requires nothing for your part, but to get a parson in
the next room; we'll find work for him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[87]</a></span></p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> That shall be done immediately; Christian, make haste, and
send for Mr Ball, the non-conformist; tell him, here are two or three
angels to be earned.</p>

<p><i>Chr.</i> And two or three possets to be eaten: May I not put in that,
madam?</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> Surely you may.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Chr.</span></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Let's have the brawls.</p>

<p><i>Mood.</i> No, good sir John, no quarrelling among friends.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> Your company is like to be increased, sir; some neighbours,
that heard your fiddles, are come a mumming to you.</p>

<p><i>Mood.</i> Let them come in, and we'll be jovy; an I had but my hobby-horse
at home&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> What, are they men, or women?</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> I believe some 'prentices broke loose.</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> Rose, go, and fetch me down two Indian gowns and
vizard-masks&mdash;&mdash;you and I will disguise too, and be as good a
mummery to them, as they to us.<br />

mine; bring two flute-glasses and some stools, ho! we'll have the
ladies' healths.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> But why stools, my lord?</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> That you shall see: the humour is, that two men at a time are
hoisted up: when they are above, they name their ladies, and the rest of
the company dance about them while they drink: This they call the frolic
of the altitudes.</p>

<p><i>Mood.</i> Some highlander's invention, I'll warrant it.</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> Gentlemen-maskers, you shall begin.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>They hoist Sir</i> <span class="smcap">Mart.</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Warn.</span></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> Ay, the best Rose you ever got in all your life.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Pulls off her mask.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> This amazeth me so much, I know not what to say, or think.</p>

<p><i>Mood.</i> My daughter married to Warner!</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> Well, I thought it impossible that any man in England should
have over-reached me: Sure, Warner, there is some mistake in this:
Pr'ythee, Billy, let's go to the parson to make all right again, that
every man have his own, before the matter go too far.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Well, sir! for my part, I will have nothing farther to do with
these women, for, I find, they will be too hard for us; but e'en sit
down by the loss, and content myself with my hard fortune: But, madam,
do you ever think I will forgive you this, to cheat me into an estate of
two thousand pounds a-year?</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> An I were as thee, I would not be so served, Warner.</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> I have served him but right, for the cheat he put upon me, when
he persuaded me you were a wit&mdash;&mdash;now, there's a trick for
your trick, sir.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Nay, I confess you have outwitted me.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Let me down, and I'll forgive all freely.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>They let him down.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Mood.</i> What am I kept here for?</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> I might in policy keep you there, till your daughter and I had
been in private, for a little consummation: But for once, sir, I'll
trust your good nature.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Takes him down too.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Mood.</i> An thou wert a gentleman, it would not grieve me.</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> That I was assured of before I married him,
by my lord here.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[91]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> I cannot refuse to own him for my kinsman, though his father's
sufferings in the late times have ruined his fortunes.</p>

<p><i>Mood.</i> But yet he has been a serving man.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> You are mistaken, sir, I have been a master; and, besides, there
is an estate of eight hundred pounds a year, only it is mortgaged for
six thousand pounds.</p>

<p><i>Mood.</i> Well, we'll bring it off; and, for my part, I am glad my
daughter has missed <i>in fine</i> there.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> I will not be the only man that must sleep without a
bed-fellow to-night, if this lady will once again receive me.</p>

<p><i>L. Dupe.</i> She's yours, sir.</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> And the same parson, that did the former execution, is still in
the next chamber; what with candles, wine, and quidding, which he has
taken in abundance, I think he will be able to wheedle two more of you
into matrimony.</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> Poor Sir Martin looks melancholy! I am half afraid he is in
love.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> Not with the lady that took him for a wit, I hope.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> At least, Sir Martin can do more than you, Mr Warner; for he can
make me a lady, which you cannot my mistress.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mart.</i> I have lost nothing but my man, and, in fine, I shall get
another.</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> You'll do very well, Sir Martin, for you'll never be your own
man, I assure you.</p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> For my part, I had loved you before, if I had followed my
inclination.</p>

<p><i>Mill.</i> But now I am afraid you begin of the latest, except your love
can grow up, like a mushroom, at a night's warning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[92]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Warn.</i> For that matter, never trouble yourself; I can love as fast as
any man, when I am nigh possession; my love falls heavy, and never moves
quick till it comes near the centre; he's an ill falconer, that will
unhood before the quarry be in sight.</p>

<h2>THE TEMPEST.</h2>

<p>In this alteration of the "Tempest," Dryden acknowledges his obligation
to Sir William Davenant, whom he extols for his quick and piercing
imagination. Sir William was the son of an inn-keeper in Oxford, whose
house was frequented by our immortal Shakespeare; and hence an
ill-founded tradition ascribed to him a paternal interest in young
Davenant: But this slander on Shakespeare's moral character has been
fully refuted in the Prolegomena to Johnson and Steevens' edition of his
plays. Davenant was appointed poet laureat upon the death of Ben Jonson.
During the civil wars, he distinguished himself on the royal side, was
lieutenant-general of ordnance to the earl of Newcastle, and was
knighted by Charles at the siege of Gloucester. He was afterwards much
trusted by Henrietta, the queen-dowager; and was finally made prisoner
by an English man of war, in attempting to convey a colony of loyalists
to Virginia. After a long captivity in the Tower, he was liberated
through the intercession of the lord-keeper, Whitelocke; the wisest and
most temperate of the counsellors of the ruling power. Through his
countenance, Sir William was protected, or connived at, in bringing
forward certain interludes and operas, even during the rigid sway of
fanaticism. After the restoration, he became manager of a company of
players, called the duke of York's servants, in distinction to the
king's company, which was directed by Killigrew. He introduced upon the
stage much pomp in dress, scenery, and decoration, as if to indemnify
the theatrical muses for the poor shifts to which they had been reduced
during the usurpation. Sir William Davenant died in 1668, at the age of
63.</p>

<p>"Gondibert," his greatest performance, incurred, when first published,
more ridicule, and in latter times more neglect, than its merits
deserve. An epic poem, in elegiac stanzas, must always be tedious,
because no structure of verse is more unfavourable to narration than
that which almost peremptorily requires each sentence to be restricted,
or protracted, to four lines. But the liveliness of Davenant's
imagination, which Dryden has pointed out as his most striking
attribute, has illuminated even the dull and dreary path which he has
chosen; and perhaps few poems afford more instances of vigorous
conceptions, and even felicity of expression, than the neglected
"Gondibert.<a name="FNanchor_A_3" id="FNanchor_A_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a></span></p>

<p>The alteration of the Tempest was Davenant's last work; and it seems to
have been undertaken, chiefly, with a view to give room for scenical
decoration. Few readers will think the play much improved by the
introduction of the sea-language, which Davenant had acquired during the
adventurous period of his life. Nevertheless, the ludicrous contest
betwixt the sailors, for the dukedom and viceroyship of a barren island,
gave much amusement at the time, and some of the expressions were long
after proverbial<a name="FNanchor_A_4" id="FNanchor_A_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a>. Much cannot be said for Davenant's ingenuity, in
contrasting the character of a woman, who had never seen a man, with
that of a man, who had never seen a woman, or in inventing a sister
monster for Caliban. The majestic simplicity of Shakespeare's plan is
injured by thus doubling his characters; and his wild landscape is
converted into a formal parterre, where "each alley has its brother." In
sketching characters drawn from fancy, and not from observation, the
palm of genius must rest with the first inventor; others are but
copyists, and a copy shews no where to such disadvantage as when placed
by the original. Besides, although we are delighted with the feminine
simplicity of Miranda, it becomes unmanly childishness in Hippolito; and
the premature coquetry of Dorinda is disgusting, when contrasted with
the maidenly purity that chastens the simplicity of Shakespeare's
heroine. The latter seems to display, as it were by instinct, the innate
dignity of her sex; the former, to shew, even in solitude, the germ of
those vices, by which, in a voluptuous age, the female character becomes
degraded. The wild and savage character of Caliban is also sunk into low
and vulgar buffoonery.</p>

<p>Dryden has not informed us of the share he had in this alteration:
It was probably little more than the care of adapting it to
the stage. The prologue is one of the most masterly tributes ever
paid at the shrine of Shakespeare.</p>

<p>From the epilogue, the Tempest appears to have been acted in
1667. Although Dryden was under engagements to the king's
company, this play was performed by the duke's servants, probably
because written in conjunction with Davenant, their manager.
It was not published until 1670.</p>

<hr class="hr3" />
<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>The writing of prefaces to plays was probably invented by some very
ambitious poet, who never thought he had done enough: Perhaps by some
ape of the French eloquence, which uses to make a business of a letter
of gallantry, an examen of a farce; and, in short, a great pomp and
ostentation of words on every trifle. This is certainly the talent of
that nation, and ought not to be invaded by any other. They do that out
of gaiety, which would be an imposition<a name="FNanchor_A_5" id="FNanchor_A_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> upon us.</p>

<p>We may satisfy ourselves with surmounting them in the scene, and safely
leave them those trappings of writings, and flourishes of the pen, with
which they adorn the borders of their plays, and which are indeed no
more than good landscapes to a very indifferent picture. I must proceed
no farther in this argument, lest I run myself beyond my excuse for
writing this. Give me leave, therefore, to tell you, reader, that I do
not set a value on any thing I have written in this play, but out
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[100]</a></span> gratitude to the memory of Sir William Davenant, who did me the
honour to join me with him in the alteration of it.</p>

<p>It was originally Shakespeare's; a poet for whom he had particularly a
high veneration, and whom he first taught me to admire. The play itself
had formerly been acted with success in the Black Friars: And our
excellent Fletcher had so great a value for it, that he thought fit to
make use of the same design, not much varied, a second time. Those, who
have seen his "Sea-Voyage," may easily discern that it was a copy of
Shakespeare's "Tempest:" The storm, the desert island, and the woman who
had never seen a man, are all sufficient testimonies of it. But Fletcher
was not the only poet who made use of Shakespeare's plot: Sir John
Suckling, a professed admirer of our author, has followed his footsteps
in his "Goblins;" his <i>Regmella</i> being an open imitation of
Shakespeare's <i>Miranda</i>, and his spirits, though counterfeit, yet are
copied from <i>Ariel</i>. But Sir William Davenant, as he was a man of a
quick and piercing imagination, soon found that somewhat might be added
to the design of Shakespeare, of which neither Fletcher nor Suckling had
ever thought: And, therefore, to put the last hand to it, he designed
the counter-part to Shakespeare's plot, namely, that of a man who had
never seen a woman; that by this means those two characters of innocence
and love might the more illustrate and commend each other. This
excellent contrivance he was pleased to communicate to me, and to desire
my assistance in it. I confess, that from the very first moment it so
pleased me, that I never writ any thing with more delight. I must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[101]</a></span>
likewise do him that justice to acknowledge, that my writing received
daily his amendments; and that is the reason why it is not so faulty, as
the rest which I have done, without the help or correction of so
judicious a friend. The comical parts of the sailors were also of his
invention, and, for the most part, his writing, as you will easily
discover by the style. In the time I writ with him, I had the
opportunity to observe somewhat more nearly of him, than I had formerly
done, when I had only a bare acquaintance with him: I found him then of
so quick a fancy, that nothing was proposed to him, on which he could
not suddenly produce a thought, extremely pleasant and surprising: and
those first thoughts of his, contrary to the old Latin proverb, were not
always the least happy. And as his fancy was quick, so likewise were the
products of it remote and new. He borrowed not of any other; and his
imagination's were such as could not easily enter into any other man.
His corrections were sober and judicious: and he corrected his own
writings much more severely than those of another man, bestowing twice
the time and labour in polishing, which he used in invention. It had
perhaps been easy enough for me to have arrogated more to myself than
was my due, in the writing of this play, and to have passed by his name
with silence in the publication of it, with the same ingratitude which
others have used to him, whose writings he hath not only corrected, as
he hath done this, but has had a greater inspection over them, and
sometimes added whole scenes together, which may as easily be
distinguished from the rest, as true gold from counterfeit, by the
weight. But, besides the unworthiness of the action, which deterred me
from it, (there being nothing so base as to rob the dead of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[102]</a></span>
reputation,) I am satisfied I could never have received so much honour,
in being thought the author of any poem, how excellent soever, as I
shall from the joining my imperfections with the merit and name of
Shakespeare and Sir William Davenant.</p>

<h2>PROLOGUE.</h2>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i2">As when a tree's cut down, the secret root</span>
  <span class="i2">Lives under ground, and thence new branches shoot;</span>
  <span class="i2">So, from old Shakespeare's honoured dust, this day</span>
  <span class="i2">Springs up and buds a new-reviving play:</span>
  <span class="i2">Shakespeare, who (taught by none) did first impart</span>
  <span class="i2">To Fletcher wit, to labouring Jonson art.</span>
  <span class="i2">He, monarch-like, gave those, his subjects, law;</span>
  <span class="i2">And is that nature which they paint and draw.</span>
  <span class="i2">Fletcher reached that which on his heights did grow,</span>
  <span class="i2">Whilst Jonson crept, and gathered all below.</span>
  <span class="i2">This did his love, and this his mirth, digest:</span>
  <span class="i2">One imitates him most, the other best.</span>
  <span class="i2">If they have since outwrit all other men,</span>
  <span class="i2">'Tis with the drops which fell from Shakespeare's pen,</span>
  <span class="i2">The storm, which vanished on the neighbouring shore,</span>
  <span class="i2">Was taught by Shakespeare's Tempest first to roar.</span>
  <span class="i2">That innocence and beauty, which did smile</span>
  <span class="i2">In Fletcher, grew on this enchanted isle.</span>
  <span class="i2">But Shakespeare's magic could not copied be;</span>
  <span class="i2">Within that circle none durst walk but he.</span>
  <span class="i2">I must confess 'twas bold, nor would you now</span>
  <span class="i2">That liberty to vulgar wits allow,</span>
  <span class="i2">Which works by magic supernatural things:</span>
  <span class="i2">But Shakespeare's power is sacred as a king's.</span>
  <span class="i2">Those legends from old priesthood were received,</span>
  <span class="i2">And he then writ, as people then believed.</span>
  <span class="i2">But if for Shakespeare we your grace implore,</span>
  <span class="i2">We for our theatre shall want it more:</span>
  <span class="i2">Who, by our dearth of youths, are forced to employ</span>
  <span class="i2">One of our women to present a boy;</span>
  <span class="i2">And that's a transformation, you will say,</span>
  <span class="i2">Exceeding all the magic in the play.</span>
  <span class="i2">Let none expect, in the last act, to find</span>
  <span class="i2">Her sex transformed from man to womankind.</span>
  <span class="i2">Whate'er she was before the play began,</span>
  <span class="i2">All you shall see of her is perfect man.</span>
  <span class="i2">Or, if your fancy will be farther led</span>
  <span class="i2">To find her woman&mdash;it must be a-bed.</span>

<hr class="hr1" />
<h3>ACT I. SCENE I.&mdash;</h3>

<blockquote><p><i>The front of the stage is opened, and the band of twenty-four violins,
with the harpsicals and theorbos which accompany the voices, are placed
between the pit and the stage. While the overture is playing, the
curtain rises, and discovers a new frontispiece, joined to the great
pilasters, on each side of the stage. This frontispiece is a noble arch,
supported by large wreathed columns of the Corinthian order; the
wreathings of the columns are beautified with roses wound round them,
and several Cupids flying about them. On the cornice, just over the
capitals, sits on either side a figure, with a trumpet in one hand, and
a palm in the other, representing Fame. A little farther, on the same
cornice, on each side of a compass-pediment, lie a lion and a unicorn,
the supporters of the royal arms of England. In the middle of the arch
are several angels, holding the king's arms, as if they were placing
them in the midst of that compass-pediment. Behind this is the scene,
which represents a thick cloudy sky, a very rocky coast, and a
tempestuous sea in perpetual agitation. This tempest (supposed to be
raised by magick) has many dreadful objects in it, as several spirits
in horrid shapes flying down amongst the sailors, then rising and
crossing in the air. And when the ship is sinking, the whole house is
darkened, and a shower of fire falls upon them. This is accompanied with
lightning, and several claps of thunder, to the end of the storm.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Must.</i> In the hollow of an old tree.</p>

<p><i>Vent.</i> Fill apace; we cannot live long in this barren island, and we
may take a sup before death, as well as others drink at our funerals.</p>

<p><i>Must.</i> This is prize brandy; we steal custom, and it costs nothing.
Let's have two rounds more.</p>

<p><i>Vent.</i> Master, what have you saved?</p>

<p><i>Steph.</i> Just nothing but myself.</p>

<p><i>Vent.</i> This works comfortably on a cold stomach.</p>

<p><i>Steph.</i> Fill us another round.</p>

<p><i>Vent.</i> Look! Mustacho weeps. Hang losses, as long as we have brandy
left!&mdash;Pr'ythee leave weeping.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[123]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Steph.</i> He sheds his brandy out of his eyes: He shall drink no more.</p>

<p><i>Must.</i> This will be a doleful day with old Bess. She gave me a gilt
nutmeg at parting; that's lost too: But, as you say, hang losses!
Pr'ythee fill again.</p>

<p><i>Vent.</i> Beshrew thy heart, for putting me in mind of thy wife; I had not
thought of mine else. Nature will shew itself, I must melt. I pr'ythee
fill again: My wife's a good old jade, and has but one eye left; but she
will weep out that too, when she hears that I am dead.</p>

<p><i>Steph.</i> 'Would you were both hanged, for putting me in thought of mine!</p>

<p><i>Vent.</i> But come, master, sorrow is dry: There's for you again.</p>

<p><i>Steph.</i> A mariner had e'en as good be a fish as a man, but for the
comfort we get ashore. O! for an old dry wench, now I am wet.</p>

<p><i>Must.</i> Poor heart, that would soon make you dry again. But all is
barren in this isle: Here we may lie at hull, till the wind blow nor'
and by south, ere we can cry, a sail! a sail! a sight of a white apron:
And, therefore, here's another sup to comfort us.</p>

<p><i>Vent.</i> This isle's our own, that's our comfort; for the duke, the
prince, and all their train, are perished.</p>

<p><i>Must.</i> Our ship is sunk, and we can never get home again: We must e'en
turn savages, and the next that catches his fellow may eat him.</p>

<p><i>Vent.</i> No, no, let us have a government; for if we live well and
orderly, heaven will drive shipwrecks ashore to make us all rich:
Therefore let us carry good consciences, and not eat one another.</p>

<p><i>Steph.</i> Whoever eats any of my subjects, I'll break out his teeth with
my sceptre; for I was master at sea, and will be duke on land: You,
Mustacho, have been my mate, and shall be my viceroy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[124]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Vent.</i> When you are duke, you may chuse your viceroy; but I am a free
subject in a new plantation, and will have no duke without my voice: And
so fill me the other sup.</p>

<p><i>Steph.</i> [<i>whispering.</i>] Ventoso, dost thou hear, I will advance thee;
pr'ythee, give me thy voice.</p>

<p><i>Vent.</i> I'll have no whisperings to corrupt the election; and, to show
that I have no private ends, I declare aloud, that I will be viceroy, or
I'll keep my voice for myself.</p>

<p><i>Must.</i> Stephano, hear me! I will speak for the people, because there
are few, or rather none, in the isle, to speak for themselves. Know,
then, that to prevent the farther shedding of christian blood, we are
all content Ventoso shall be viceroy, upon condition I may be viceroy
over him. Speak, good people, are you well agreed? what, no man answer?
Well, you may take their silence for consent.</p>

<p><i>Vent.</i> You speak for the people, Mustacho! I'll speak for them, and
declare generally with one voice, one and all, that there shall be no
viceroy but the duke, unless I be he.</p>

<p><i>Must.</i> You declare for the people, who never saw your face? Cold iron
shall decide it!<br />

spirits hear me, and yet I needs must curse; but they'll not pinch,
fright me with urchin shows, pitch me i'the mire, nor lead me in the
dark out of my way, unless he bid them. But for every trifle he sets
them on me: Sometimes, like baboons, they mow and chatter at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[127]</a></span>
me, and often bite me; like hedge-hogs, then, they mount their prickles
at me, tumbling before me in my barefoot way. Sometimes I am all wound
about with adders, who, with their cloven tongues, hiss me to
madness.&mdash;Ha! yonder stands one of his spirits, sent to torment me.</p>

<p><i>Trinc.</i> What have we here, a man, or a fish? This is some monster of
the isle. Were I in England, as once I was, and had him painted, not a
holiday fool there but would give me sixpence for the sight of him.
Well, if I could make him tame, he were a present for an
emperor.&mdash;Come hither, pretty monster; I'll do thee no harm: Come
hither!</p>

<p><i>Calib.</i> Torment me not; I'll bring the wood home faster.</p>

<p><i>Trinc.</i> He talks none of the wisest; but I'll give him a dram o'the
bottle, that will clear his understanding.&mdash;Come on your ways,
master monster, open your mouth: How now, you perverse moon-calf! what,
I think you cannot tell who is your friend?&mdash;Open your chops, I
say.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Pours wine down his throat.</i></span><br /></p>

him.</p>

art thou content to turn civil and sober, as I am? for then thou shalt
be my subject.</p>

<p><i>Calib.</i> I'll swear upon that bottle to be true; for the liquor is not
earthly. Did'st thou not drop from heaven?</p>

<p><i>Trinc.</i> Only out of the moon; I was the man in her, when time
was.&mdash;By this light, a very shallow monster.</p>

foot: I pr'ythee be my god, and let me drink.<br />

long nails, will dig thee pig-nuts, shew thee a jay's nest, and instruct
thee how to snare the marmozet: I'll bring thee to clustered filberts.

more of thy kin in this island?</p>

<p><i>Calib.</i> Divine, here is but one besides myself; my lovely sister,
beautiful and bright as the full moon!</p>

<p><i>Trinc.</i> Where is she?</p>

<p><i>Calib.</i> I left her clambering up a hollow oak, and plucking thence the
dropping honey-combs.&mdash;Say, my king, shall I call her to thee?</p>

<p><i>Trinc.</i> She shall swear upon the bottle too. If she proves handsome,
she is mine.&mdash;Here, monster, drink again for thy good news; thou
shalt speak a good word for me.<br />

<p><i>Calib.</i> In all this isle there are but two more, the daughters of the

she's heir of all this isle (for I will geld monster). The Trincalos,
like other wise men, have anciently used to marry for estate, more than
for beauty.</p>

badge of my sea-office; my fair fuss, thou dost not know it.</p>

<p><i>Syc.</i> No, my dread lord.</p>

<p><i>Trinc.</i> It shall be a whistle for our first babe, and when the next
shipwreck puts me again to swimming, I'll dive to get a coral to it.</p>

<p><i>Syc.</i> I'll be thy pretty child, and wear it first.</p>

<p><i>Trinc.</i> I pr'ythee, sweet baby, do not play the wanton, and cry for my
goods ere I'm dead. When thou art my widow, thou shalt have the devil
and all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[152]</a></span></p>

then! I would not change my dukedom to be great Turk Trincalo.</p>

drunk it up, like a debauched fish as thou art. Let

thy shoe.</p>

<p><i>Trinc.</i> I could find in my heart to turn thee out of my dominions, for
a liquorish monster.</p>

<p><i>Calib.</i> O, my lord, I have found it out; this must be done by one of
Prospero's spirits.</p>

<p><i>Trinc.</i> There's nothing but malice in these devils; I would it had been
holy-water for their sakes!</p>

<p><i>Syc.</i> 'Tis no matter, I will cleave to thee.</p>

<p><i>Trinc.</i> Lovingly said, in troth: Now cannot I hold out against her.
This wife-like virtue of her's has overcome me.</p>

<p><i>Syc.</i> Shall I have thee in my arms?</p>

<p><i>Trinc.</i> Thou shalt have Duke Trincalo in thy arms: But, pr'ythee, be
not too boisterous with me at first; do not discourage a young beginner.

but a small remainder of brandy,) are come to treat a peace betwixt us,
which may be for the good of both armies; therefore, Trincalo, disband.</p>

<p><i>Trinc.</i> Plain Trincalo! methinks I might have been a duke in your

sent us, in the first place, to demand of you, upon what ground you make
war against him; having no right to govern here, as being elected only
by your own voice.</p>

and having homage done me by this hectoring spark her brother; from
these two I claim a lawful title to this island.</p>

<p><i>Must.</i> Who, that monster? He a Hector?</p>

<p><i>Calib.</i> Lo, how he mocks me! wilt thou let him, my lord?</p>

<p><i>Trinc.</i> Viceroys! keep good tongues in your heads, I advise you, and
proceed to your business.</p>

<p><i>Must.</i> First and foremost, as to your claim, that you have answered.</p>

<p><i>Vent.</i> But, second and foremost, we demand of you, that if we make a
peace, the butt also may be comprehended in the treaty.</p>

<p><i>Trinc.</i> I cannot treat with my honour, without your submission.</p>

<p><i>Steph.</i> I understand, being present, from my ambassadors, what your
resolution is, and ask an hour's time of deliberation, and so I take our
leave; but first I desire to be entertained at your butt, as becomes a
prince and his ambassadors.</p>

<p><i>Trinc.</i> That I refuse, till acts of hostility be ceased. These rogues
are rather spies than ambassadors. I must take heed of my butt. They
come to pry into the secrets of my dukedom.</p>

<p><i>Steph.</i> An't please your grace, she's somewhat homely, but that's no

knows it, and so here's to thee again.&mdash;Give me the bottle,
Caliban! did you knock the butt? How does it sound?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">MAY IT PLEASE YOUR GRACE,</span></p>

<p>Amongst those few persons of wit and honour, whose favourable opinion I
have desired, your own virtue, and my great obligations to your grace,
have justly given you the precedence. For what could be more glorious to
me, than to have acquired some part of your esteem, who are admired and
honoured by all good men; who have been, for so many years together,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
the pattern and standard of honour to the nation; and whose whole life
has been so great an example of heroic virtue, that we might wonder how
it happened into an age so corrupt as ours, if it had not likewise been
a part of the former. As you came into the world with all the advantages
of a noble birth and education, so you have rendered both yet more
conspicuous by your virtue. Fortune, indeed, has perpetually crowned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
your undertakings with success, but she has only waited on your valour,
not conducted it. She has ministered to your glory like a slave, and has
been led in triumph by it; or, at most, while honour led you by the hand
to greatness, fortune only followed to keep you from sliding back in the
ascent. That, which Plutarch accounted her favour to Cymon and Lucullus,
was but her justice to your grace; and, never to have been overcome
where you led in person, as it was more than Hannibal could boast, so it
was all that Providence could do for that party, which it had resolved
to ruin. Thus, my lord, the last smiles of victory were on your arms;
and, everywhere else declaring for the rebels, she seemed to suspend
herself, and to doubt, before she took her flight, whether she were able
wholly to abandon that cause, for which you fought<a name="FNanchor_A_8" id="FNanchor_A_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a>.</p>

<p>But the greatest trials of your courage and constancy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
were yet to come: Many had ventured their fortunes, and exposed their
lives to the utmost dangers for their king and country, who ended their
loyalty with the war; and, submitting to the iniquity of the times,
chose rather to redeem their former plenty, by acknowledging an usurper,
than to suffer with an unprofitable fidelity (as those meaner spirits
called it) for their lawful sovereign. But, as I dare not accuse so many
of our nobility, who were content to accept their patrimonies from the
clemency of the conqueror, and to retain only a secret veneration for
their prince, amidst the open worship which they were forced to pay to
the usurper, who had dethroned him; so, I hope, I may have leave to
extol that virtue which acted more generously; and which was not
satisfied with an inward devotion to monarchy, but produced itself to
view, and asserted the cause by open martyrdom. Of these rare patterns
of loyalty, your grace was chief: Those examples you could not find, you
made. Some few Cato's there were with you, whose invincible resolution
could not be conquered by that usurping Cæsar. Your virtue opposed
itself to his fortune, and overcame it, by not submitting to it. The
last and most difficult enterprize he had to effect, when he had
conquered three nations, was to subdue your spirit; and he died weary of
that war, and unable to finish it.</p>

<p>In the mean time, you lived more happily in your exile, than the other
on his throne. Your loyalty made you friends and servants amongst
foreigners; and you lived plentifully without a fortune; for you lived
on your own desert and reputation. The glorious name of the valiant and
faithful Newcastle, was a patrimony which could never be exhausted.</p>

<p>Thus, my lord, the morning of your life was clear and calm; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
though it was afterwards overcast, yet, in that general storm, you were
never without a shelter. And now you are happily arrived to the evening
of a day, as serene as the dawn of it was glorious; but such an evening
as, I hope, and almost prophecy, is far from night: 'Tis the evening of
a summer's sun, which keeps the day-light long within the skies. The
health of your body is maintained by the vigour of your mind: Neither
does the one shrink from the fatigue of exercise, nor the other bend
under the pains of study. Methinks, I behold in you another Caius
Marius, who, in the extremity of his age, exercised himself almost every
morning in the Campus Martius, amongst the youthful nobility of Rome.
And afterwards in your retirements, when you do honour to poetry, by
employing part of your leisure in it, I regard you as another Silius
Italicus, who, having passed over his consulship with applause,
dismissed himself from business, and from the gown, and employed his
age, amongst the shades, in the reading and imitation of Virgil.</p>

<p>In which, lest any thing should be wanting to your happiness, you have,
by a rare effect of fortune, found, in the person of your excellent
lady, not only a lover, but a partner of your studies; a lady whom our
age may justly equal with the Sappho of the Greeks, or the Sulpitia of
the Romans; who, by being taken into your bosom, seems to be inspired
with your genius; and, by writing the history of your life<a name="FNanchor_A_9" id="FNanchor_A_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a>,
in so masculine a style, has already placed you in the number of
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span> heroes. She has anticipated that great portion of fame,
which envy often hinders a living virtue from possessing; which would,
indeed, have been given to your ashes, but with a later payment; and of
which you could have no present use, except it were by a secret presage
of that which was to come, when you were no longer in a possibility of
knowing it. So that if that were a praise, or satisfaction to the
greatest of emperors, which the most judicious of poets gives him&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i2"><i>Præsenti tibi maturos largimur honores, &amp;c.</i></span>
 </div>
</div>

<p>that the adoration, which was not allowed to Hercules and Romulus till
after death, was given to Augustus living, then certainly it cannot be
denied, but that your grace has received a double satisfaction: the one,
to see yourself consecrated to immortality while you are yet alive; the
other, to have your praises celebrated by so dear, so just, and so pious
an historian.</p>

<p>It is the consideration of this that stops my pen; though I am loth to
leave so fair a subject, which gives me as much field as poetry could
wish, and yet no more than truth can justify. But to attempt any thing
of a panegyric, were to enterprize on your lady's right; and to seem to
affect those praises, which none but the duchess of Newcastle can
deserve, when she writes the actions of her lord. I shall, therefore,
leave that wider space, and contract myself to those narrow bounds,
which best become my fortune and employment.</p>

<p>I am obliged, my lord, to return you not only my own acknowledgments,
but to thank you in the names of former poets; the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'manes'">names</ins> of Jonson and
D'Avenant<a name="FNanchor_A_10" id="FNanchor_A_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a> seem to require it from me, that those favours, which you
placed on them, and which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span> wanted opportunity to own in public,
yet might not be lost to the knowledge of posterity, with a
forgetfulness unbecoming of the Muses, who are the daughters of memory.
And give me leave, my lord, to avow so much of vanity, as to say, I am
proud to be their remembrancer: For, by relating how gracious you have
been to them, and are to me, I, in some measure, join my name with
theirs: And the continued descent of your favours to me is the best
title which I can plead for my succession. I only wish, that I had as
great reason to be satisfied with myself, in the return of our common
acknowledgments, as your grace may justly take in the conferring them:
For I cannot but be very sensible, that the present of an ill comedy,
which I here make you, is a very unsuitable way of giving thanks for
them, who, themselves, have written so many better. This pretends to
nothing more, than to be a foil to those scenes, which are composed by
the most noble poet of our age and nation; and to be set as a water-mark
of the lowest ebb, to which the wit of my predecessor has sunk, and run
down in me. But, though all of them have surpassed me in the scene,
there is one part of glory, in which I will not yield to any of them: I
mean, my lord, that honour and veneration which they had for you in
their lives; and which I preserve after them, more holily than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>

<h2>AN EVENING'S LOVE.</h2>

<p>Our author acknowledges, that this play of "The Mock Astrologer" is
founded on "<i>Le feint Astrologue</i>," by the younger Corneille, which he,
in his turn, had imitated from "<i>El Astrologo fingido</i>" of Calderon. But
Dryden has also laid Moliere under contribution. Most part of the
quarrelling scene betwixt Wildblood and Jacintha, in the fourth act, is
literally copied from that betwixt Lucile Eraste, Marinette, and Gros
René, in "<i>Le Depit Amoureux</i>." The absurd loquacity of Don Alonzo, and
his friend's mode of silencing him, by ringing a bell in his ears, is
imitated from the scene betwixt Albert and Metaphraste, in the same
play; and, it must be allowed, it is an expedient which might be more
decently resorted to against an inundation of nonsense from a pedantic
schoolmaster, as in Moliere, than to stop the mouth of a noble old
Spaniard, the uncle of Don Lopez' mistress. The play itself is more
lively than most of Dryden's comedies. Wildblood and Jacintha are far
more pleasant than their prototypes, Celadon and Florimel; and the
Spanish bustle of the plot is well calculated to keep up the attention.
The character of Aurelia was perhaps suggested by the "<i>Precieuses
Ridicules</i>" of Moliere, but cannot, with any justice, be said to be
copied from them. The Preface contains some excellent remarks on the old
comedy. There is also an elaborate defence, the first our poet deigned
to make, against the charge of plagiarism. On this point he quotes the
words of Charles II., who had only desired, that they, who accused
Dryden of theft, would steal him such plays as Dryden's: And he
vindicates the right of an author to take his plot where he could best
find it, in history or romance, providing that the conduct and
disposition of the action, with the dialogue, character, and poetical
ornaments, were original. Our author's use of the terms and technical
phrases of judicial astronomy intimate his acquaintance with that
pretended science, in which he is known to have placed some confidence.</p>

<p>The "Mock Astrologer" appears to have been acted and published
in 1668.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="THE_PREFACE1" id="THE_PREFACE1"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>I had thought, reader, in this preface, to have written somewhat
concerning the difference betwixt the plays of our age, and those of our
predecessors, on the English stage: To have shewn in what parts of
dramatic poesy we were excelled by Ben Jonson, I mean, humour, and
contrivance of comedy; and in what we may justly claim precedence of
Shakespeare and Fletcher, namely in heroic plays: But this design I have
waved on second considerations; at least, deferred it till I publish The
Conquest of Granada, where the discourse will be more proper. I had also
prepared to treat of the improvement of our language since Fletcher's
and Jonson's days, and consequently of our refining the courtship,
raillery, and conversation of plays: But as I am willing to decline that
envy which I should draw on myself from some old <i>opiniatre</i> judges of
the stage, so likewise I am prest in time so much that I have not
leisure, at present, to go through with it. Neither, indeed, do I value
a reputation gained from comedy, so far as to concern myself
about it, any more than I needs must in my own defence:
For I think it, in its own nature, inferior to all sorts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
dramatick writing. Low comedy especially requires, on the writer's part,
much of conversation with the vulgar, and much of ill nature in the
observation of their follies. But let all men please themselves
according to their several tastes: That which is not pleasant to me, may
be to others who judge better: And, to prevent an accusation from my
enemies, I am sometimes ready to imagine, that my disgust of low comedy
proceeds not so much from my judgment as from my temper; which is the
reason why I so seldom write it; and that when I succeed in it, (I mean
so far as to please the audience) yet I am nothing satisfied with what I
have done; but am often vexed to hear the people laugh, and clap, as
they perpetually do, where intended them no jest; while they let pass
the better things, without taking notice of them. Yet even this confirms
me in my opinion of slighting popular applause, and of contemning that
approbation which those very people give, equally with me, to the zany
of a mountebank; or to the appearance of an antick on the theatre,
without wit on the poet's part, or any occasion of laughter from the
actor, besides the ridiculousness of his habit and his grimaces.</p>

<p>But I have descended, before I was aware, from comedy to farce; which
consists principally of grimaces. That I admire not any comedy equally
with tragedy, is, perhaps, from the sullenness of my humour; but that I
detest those farces, which are now the most frequent entertainments of
the stage, I am sure I have reason on my side. Comedy consists, though
of low persons, yet of natural actions and characters; I mean such
humours, adventures, and designs, as are to be found and met
with in the world. Farce, on the other side, consists of
forced humours, and unnatural events. Comedy presents us with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
imperfections of human nature: Farce entertains us with what is
monstrous and chimerical. The one causes laughter in those who can judge
of men and manners, by the lively representation of their folly or
corruption: The other produces the same effect in those who can judge of
neither, and that only by its extravagances. The first works on the
judgment and fancy; the latter on the fancy only: There is more of
satisfaction in the former kind of laughter, and in the latter more of
scorn. But, how it happens, that an impossible adventure should cause
our mirth, I cannot so easily imagine. Something there may be in the
oddness of it, because on the stage it is the common effect of things
unexpected, to surprise us into a delight: and that is to be ascribed to
the strange appetite, as I may call it, of the fancy; which, like that
of a longing woman, often runs out into the most extravagant desires;
and is better satisfied sometimes with loam, or with the rinds of trees,
than with the wholesome nourishments of life. In short, there is the
same difference betwixt farce and comedy, as betwixt an empirick, and a
true physician: Both of them may attain their ends; but what the one
performs by hazard, the other does by skill. And as the artist is often
unsuccessful, while the mountebank succeeds; so farces more commonly
take the people than comedies. For, to write unnatural things, is the
most probable way of pleasing them, who understand not nature. And a
true poet often misses of applause, because he cannot debase himself to
write so ill as to please his audience.</p>

<p>After all, it is to be acknowledged, that most of those comedies, which
have been lately written, have been allied too much to farce: And this
must of necessity fall out, till we forbear the translation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
French plays: For their poets, wanting judgment to make or to maintain
true characters, strive to cover their defects with ridiculous figures
and grimaces. While I say this, I accuse myself as well as others: And
this very play would rise up in judgment against me, if I would defend
all things I have written to be natural: But I confess I have given too
much to the people in it, and am ashamed for them as well as for myself,
that I have pleased them at so cheap a rate. Not that there is any thing
here which I would not defend to an ill-natured judge; (for I despise
their censures, who I am sure would write worse on the same subject:)
but, because I love to deal clearly and plainly, and to speak of my own
faults with more criticism, than I would of another poet's. Yet I think
it no vanity to say, that this comedy has as much of entertainment in
it, as many others which have been lately written: And, if I find my own
errors in it, I am able, at the same time, to arraign all my
contemporaries for greater. As I pretend not that I can write humour, so
none of them can reasonably pretend to have written it as they ought.
Jonson was the only man, of all ages and nations, who has performed it
well; and that but in three or four of his comedies: The rest are but a
<i>crambe bis cocta;</i> the same humours a little varied and written worse.
Neither was it more allowable in him, than it is in our present poets,
to represent the follies of particular persons; of which many have
accused him. <i>Parcere personis, dicere de vitiis</i>, is the rule of plays.
And Horace tells you, that the old comedy amongst the Grecians was
silenced for the too great liberties of the poets:</p>

  <span class="i2"><i>Turpiter obticuit, sublato jure nocendi.</i></span>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Of which he gives you the reason in another place: where, having given
the precept,</p>

 </div>
</div>

<p>But Ben Jonson is to be admired for many excellencies; and can be taxed
with fewer failings than any English poet. I know I have been accused as
an enemy of his writings; but without any other reason, than that I do
not admire him blindly, and without looking into his imperfections. For
why should he only be exempted from those frailties, from which Homer
and Virgil are not free? Or why should there be any <i>ipse dixit</i> in our
poetry, any more than there is in our philosophy? I admire and applaud
him where I ought: Those, who do more, do but value themselves in their
admiration of him; and, by telling you they extol Ben Jonson's way,
would insinuate to you that they can practise it. For my part, I declare
that I want judgment to imitate him; and should think it a great
impudence in myself to attempt it. To make men appear pleasantly
ridiculous on the stage, was, as I have said, his talent; and in this he
needed not the acumen of wit, but that of judgment. For the characters
and representations of folly are only the effects of observation; and
observation is an effect of judgment. Some ingenious men, for whom I
have a particular esteem, have thought I have much injured Ben Jonson,
when I have not allowed his wit to be extraordinary: But they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
confound the notion of what is witty, with what is pleasant. That Ben
Jonson's plays were pleasant, he must want reason who denies: But that
pleasantness was not properly wit, or the sharpness of conceit; but the
natural imitation of folly: Which I confess to be excellent in its kind,
but not to be of that kind which they pretend. Yet if we will believe
Quintilian, in his chapter <i>de movendo risu</i>, he gives his opinion of
both in these following words: <i>Stulta reprehendere facillimum est; nam
per se sunt ridicula, et à derisu non procul abest risus: Sed rem
urbanam facit aliqua ex nobis adjectio.</i></p>

<p>And some perhaps would be apt to say of Jonson, as it was said of
Demosthenes,&mdash;<i>non displicuisse illi jocos, sed non contigisse</i>. I
will not deny, but that I approve most the mixt way of comedy; that
which is neither all wit, nor all humour, but the result of both.
Neither so little of humour as Fletcher shews, nor so little of love and
wit as Jonson; neither all cheat, with which the best plays of the one
are filled, nor all adventure, which is the common practice of the
other. I would have the characters well chosen, and kept distant from
interfering with each other; which is more than Fletcher or Shakespeare
did: But I would have more of the <i>urbana, venusta, salsa, faceta</i>, and
the rest which Quintilian reckons up as the ornaments of wit; and these
are extremely wanting in Ben Jonson. As for repartee, in particular; as
it is the very soul of conversation, so it is the greatest grace of
comedy, where it is proper to the characters. There may be much of
acuteness in a thing well said; but there is more in a quick reply:
<i>Sunt enim longè venustiora omnia in respondendo quàm in provocando.</i> Of
one thing I am sure, that no man ever will decry wit, but he who
despairs of it himself; and who has no other quarrel to it, but that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
which the fox had to the grapes. Yet, as Mr Cowley (who had a greater
portion of it than any man I know) tells us in his <i>Character of
Wit</i>,&mdash;rather than all wit, let there be none. I think there is no
folly so great in any poet of our age, as the superfluity and waste of
wit was in some of our predecessors: particularly we may say of Fletcher
and of Shakespeare, what was said of Ovid, <i>In omni ejus ingenio,
facilius quod rejici, quàm quod adjici potest, invenies</i>: The contrary
of which was true in Virgil, and our incomparable Jonson.</p>

<p>Some enemies of repartee have observed to us, that there is a great
latitude in their characters, which are made to speak it: and that it is
easier to write wit than humour; because, in the characters of humour,
the poet is confined to make the person speak what is only proper to it;
whereas, all kind of wit is proper in the character of a witty person.
But, by their favour, there are as different characters in wit as in
folly. Neither is all kind of wit proper in the mouth of every ingenious
person. A witty coward, and a witty brave, must speak differently.
<i>Falstaff</i> and the <i>Liar</i> speak not like <i>Don John</i> in the "Chances,"
and <i>Valentine</i> in "Wit without Money." And Jonson's <i>Truewit</i> in the
"Silent Woman," is a character different from all of them. Yet it
appears, that this one character of wit was more difficult to the
author, than all his images of humour in the play: for those he could
describe and manage from his observations of men; this he has taken, at
least a part of it, from books; Witness the speeches in the first act,
translated <i>verbatim</i> out of Ovid, "<i>De Arte Amandi</i>." To omit what
afterwards he borrowed from the sixth satire of Juvenal against women.</p>

<p>However, if I should grant, that there were a greater latitude
in characters of wit, than in those of humour; yet that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
latitude would be of small advantage to such poets, who have too narrow
an imagination to write it. And to entertain an audience perpetually
with humour, is to carry them from the conversation of gentlemen, and
treat them with the follies and extravagancies of Bedlam.</p>

<p>I find I have launched out farther than I intended in the beginning of
this preface; and that, in the heat of writing, I have touched at
something, which I thought to have avoided. It is time now to draw
homeward; and to think rather of defending myself, than assaulting
others. I have already acknowledged, that this play is far from perfect:
But I do not think myself obliged to discover the imperfections of it to
my adversaries, any more than a guilty person is bound to accuse himself
before his judges. It is charged upon me that I make debauched persons
(such as, they say, my Astrologer and Gamester are) my protagonists, or
the chief persons of the drama; and that I make them happy in the
conclusion of my play; against the law of comedy, which is to reward
virtue, and punish vice. I answer, first, that I know no such law to
have been constantly observed in comedy, either by the ancient or modern
poets. <i>Chærea</i> is made happy in the "Eunuch," after having deflowered a
virgin; and Terence generally does the same through all his plays, where
you perpetually see, not only debauched young men enjoy their
mistresses, but even the courtezans themselves rewarded and honoured in
the catastrophe. The same may be observed in Plautus almost everywhere.
Ben Jonson himself, after whom I may be proud to err, has given me more
than once the example of it. That in "The Alchemist" is notorious, where
<i>Face</i>, after having contrived and carried on the great cozenage
of the play, and continued in it without repentance to the last,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
is not only forgiven by his master, but enriched, by his consent, with
the spoils of those whom he had cheated. And, which is more, his master
himself, a grave man, and a widower, is introduced taking his man's
counsel, debauching the widow first, in hope to marry her afterward. In
the "Silent Woman," <i>Dauphine</i> (who, with the other two gentlemen, is of
the same character with my <i>Celadon</i> in the "Maiden Queen," and with
<i>Wildblood</i> in this) professes himself in love with all the collegiate
ladies: and they likewise are all of the same character with each other,
excepting only <i>Madam Otter</i>, who has something singular: Yet this
naughty <i>Dauphine</i> is crowned in the end with the possession of his
uncle's estate, and with the hopes of enjoying all his mistresses; and
his friend, <i>Mr Truewit</i>, (the best character of a gentleman which Ben
Jonson ever made) is not ashamed to pimp for him. As for Beaumont and
Fletcher, I need not allege examples out of them; for that were to quote
almost all their comedies. But now it will be objected, that I patronise
vice by the authority of former poets, and extenuate my own faults by
recrimination. I answer, that as I defend myself by their example, so
that example I defend by reason, and by the end of all dramatic poesy.
In the first place, therefore, give me leave to shew you their mistake,
who have accused me. They have not distinguished, as they ought, betwixt
the rules of tragedy and comedy. In tragedy, where the actions and
persons are great, and the crimes horrid, the laws of justice are more
strictly observed; and examples of punishment to be made, to deter
mankind from the pursuit of vice. Faults of this kind have been rare
amongst the ancient poets: for they have punished in <i>Oedipus</i>,
and in his posterity, the sin which he knew not he had committed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
<i>Medea</i> is the only example I remember at present, who escapes from
punishment after murder. Thus tragedy fulfils one great part of its
institution; which is, by example, to instruct. But in comedy it is not
so; for the chief end of it is divertisement and delight: and that so
much, that it is disputed, I think, by Heinsius, before Horace's "Art of
Poetry," whether instruction be any part of its employment. At least I
am sure it can be but its secondary end: for the business of the poet is
to make you laugh: when he writes humour, he makes folly ridiculous;
when wit, he moves you, if not always to laughter, yet to a pleasure
that is more noble. And if he works a cure on folly, and the small
imperfections in mankind, by exposing them to public view, that cure is
not performed by an immediate operation: For it works first on the
ill-nature of the audience; they are moved to laugh by the
representation of deformity; and the shame of that laughter teaches us
to amend what is ridiculous in our manners. This being then established,
that the first end of comedy is delight, and instruction only the
second; it may reasonably be inferred, that comedy is not so much
obliged to the punishment of faults which it represents, as tragedy. For
the persons in comedy are of a lower quality, the action is little, and
the faults and vices are but the sallies of youth, and the frailties of
human nature, and not premeditated crimes: such to which all men are
obnoxious; not such as are attempted only by few, and those abandoned to
all sense of virtue: such as move pity and commiseration; not
detestation and horror: such, in short, as may be forgiven; not such as
must of necessity be punished. But, lest any man should think that I
write this to make libertinism amiable, or that I cared not to
debase the end and institution of comedy, so I might thereby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
maintain my own errors, and those of better poets, I must further
declare, both for them and for myself, that we make not vicious persons
happy, but only as Heaven makes sinners so; that is, by reclaiming them
first from vice. For so it is to be supposed they are, when they resolve
to marry; for then, enjoying what they desire in one, they cease to
pursue the love of many. So <i>Chærea</i> is made happy by Terence, in
marrying her whom he had deflowered: and so are <i>Wildblood</i> and the
<i>Astrologer</i> in this play.</p>

<p>There is another crime with which I am charged, at which I am yet much
less concerned, because it does not relate to my manners, as the former
did, but only to my reputation as a poet: a name of which I assure the
reader I am nothing proud; and therefore cannot be very solicitous to
defend it. I am taxed with stealing all my plays, and that by some, who
should be the last men from whom I would steal any part of them. There
is one answer which I will not make; but it has been made for me, by him
to whose grace and patronage I owe all things,</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i2"><i>Et spes et ratio studiorum in Cæsare tantum</i>&mdash;</span>
 </div>
</div>

<p>and without whose command they should no longer be troubled with any
thing of mine;&mdash;that he only desired, that they, who accused me of
theft, would always steal him plays like mine. But though I have reason
to be proud of this defence, yet I should wave it, because I have a
worse opinion of my own comedies than any of my enemies can have. It is
true, that wherever I have liked any story in a romance, novel, or
foreign play, I have made no difficulty, nor ever shall, to take the
foundation of it, to build it up, and to make it proper for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
English stage. And I will be so vain to say, it has lost nothing in my
hands: But it always cost me so much trouble to heighten it for our
theatre, (which is incomparably more curious in all the ornaments of
dramatic poesy than the French or Spanish,) that when I had finished my
play, it was like the hulk of Sir Francis Drake, so strangely altered,
that there scarcely remained any plank of the timber which first built
it. To witness this, I need go no farther than this play: it was first
Spanish, and called "El Astrologo Fingido;" then made French by the
younger Corneille; and is now translated into English, and in print,
under the name of "The Feigned Astrologer." What I have performed in
this will best appear by comparing it with those: You will see that I
have rejected some adventures which I judged were not divertising; that
I have heightened those which I have chosen; and that I have added
others, which were neither in the French nor Spanish. And, besides, you
will easily discover, that the walk of the <i>Astrologer</i> is the least
considerable in my play: For the design of it turns more on the parts of
<i>Wildblood</i> and <i>Jacinta</i>, who are the chief persons in it. I have
farther to add, that I seldom use the wit and language of any romance or
play, which I undertake to alter: because my own invention (as bad as it
is) can furnish me with nothing so dull as what is there. Those who have
called Virgil, Terence, and Tasso, plagiaries, (though they much injured
them) had yet a better colour for their accusation; for Virgil has
evidently translated Theocritus, Hesiod, and Homer, in many places;
besides what he has taken from Ennius in his own language. Terence was
not only known to translate Menander, (which he avows also in his
prologues) but was said also to be helped in those translations by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
Scipio the African, and Lælius. And Tasso, the most excellent of modern
poets, and whom I reverence next to Virgil, has taken both from Homer
many admirable things, which were left untouched by Virgil, and from
Virgil himself, where Homer could not furnish him. Yet the bodies of
Virgil's and Tasso's poems were their own; and so are all the ornaments
of language and elocution in them. The same (if there were any thing
commendable in this play) I could say for it. But I will come nearer to
our own countrymen. Most of Shakespeare's plays, I mean the stories of
them, are to be found in the "Hecatomithi," or "Hundred Novels" of
Cinthio. I have myself read in his Italian, that of "Romeo and Juliet,"
the "Moor of Venice," and many others of them. Beaumont and Fletcher had
most of theirs from Spanish novels: Witness "The Chances," "The Spanish
Curate," "Rule a Wife and have a Wife," "The Little French Lawyer," and
so many others of them as compose the greatest part of their volume in
folio. Ben Jonson, indeed, has designed his plots himself; but no man
has borrowed so much from the ancients as he has done: and he did well
in it, for he has thereby beautified our language.</p>

<p>But these little critics do not well consider what is the work of a
poet, and what the graces of a poem: the story is the least part of
either: I mean the foundation of it, before it is modelled by the art of
him who writes it; who forms it with more care, by exposing only the
beautiful parts of it to view, than a skilful lapidary sets a jewel. On
this foundation of the story, the characters are raised: and, since no
story can afford characters enough for the variety of the English stage,
it follows, that it is to be altered and enlarged with new persons,
accidents, and designs, which will almost make it new. When this is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
done, the forming it into acts and scenes, disposing of actions and
passions into their proper places, and beautifying both with
descriptions, similitudes, and propriety of language, is the principal
employment of the poet; as being the largest field of fancy, which is
the principal quality required in him: for so much the word [Greek:
poiêtês] implies. Judgment, indeed, is necessary in him; but it is fancy
that gives the life-touches, and the secret graces to it; especially in
serious plays, which depend not much on observation. For, to write
humour in comedy, (which is the theft of poets from mankind) little of
fancy is required; the poet observes only what is ridiculous and
pleasant folly, and by judging exactly what is so, he pleases in the
representation of it.</p>

<p>But, in general, the employment of a poet is like that of a curious
gunsmith, or watchmaker: the iron or silver is not his own; but they are
the least part of that which gives the value: the price lies wholly in
the workmanship. And he who works dully on a story, without moving
laughter in a comedy, or raising concernment in a serious play, is no
more to be accounted a good poet, than a gunsmith of the Minories is to
be compared with the best workman of the town.</p>

<p>But I have said more of this than I intended; and more, perhaps, than I
needed to have done: I shall but laugh at them hereafter, who accuse me
with so little reason; and withal contemn their dulness, who, if they
could ruin that little reputation I have got, and which I value not, yet
would want both wit and learning to establish their own; or to be
remembered in after ages for any thing, but only that which makes them
ridiculous in this.</p>

  <span class="i2">He laid about him, and did so bestir him,</span>
  <span class="i2">His muse could never lie in quiet for him:</span>

  <span class="i2">Yet the ungrateful drudgery must last:</span>
  <span class="i2">And he is bound, as civil husbands do,</span>
  <span class="i2">To strain himself, in complaisance to you:</span>
  <span class="i2">To write in pain, and counterfeit a bliss,</span>
  <span class="i2">Like the faint smacking of an after-kiss.</span>
  <span class="i2">But you, like wives ill pleased, supply his want;</span>

  <span class="i2">But should these janty lovers daily come</span>
  <span class="i2">To do your work, like your good man at home,</span>
  <span class="i2">Their fine small-timbered wits would soon decay;</span>
  <span class="i2">These are gallants but for a holiday.</span>
  <span class="i2">Others you had, who oftner have appeared,</span>
  <span class="i2">Whom, for mere impotence, you have cashiered:</span>
  <span class="i2">Such as at first came on with pomp and glory,</span>
  <span class="i2">But, overstraining, soon fell flat before ye.</span>
  <span class="i2">Their useless weight, with patience, long was born,</span>
  <span class="i2">But at the last you threw them off with scorn.</span>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Give the Don his due, he entertained us nobly this carnival.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Give the devil the Don, for any thing I liked in his
entertainment.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> I hope we had variety enough.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Ay, it looked like variety, till we came to taste it; there were
twenty several dishes to the eye, but in the palate, nothing but spices.
I had a mind to eat of a pheasant, and as soon as I got it into my
mouth, I found I was chewing a limb of cinnamon; then I went to cut a
piece of kid, and no sooner it had touched my lips, but it turned to red
pepper: At last I began to think myself another kind of Midas, that
every thing I touched should be turned to spice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> And, for my part, I imagined his Catholic majesty had invited us
to eat his Indies. But pr'ythee, let's leave the discourse of it, and
contrive together how we may spend the evening; for in this hot country,
'tis as in the creation, the evening and the morning make the day.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> I have a little serious business.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Put it off till a fitter season: For the truth is, business is
then only tolerable, when the world and the flesh have no baits to set
before us for the day.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> But mine, perhaps, is public business.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Why, is any business more public than drinking and wenching? Look
on those grave plodding fellows, that pass by us as though they were
meditating the reconquest of Flanders: Fly them to a mark, and I'll
undertake three parts of four are going to their courtezans. I tell
thee, Jack, the whisking of a silk gown, and the rush of a tabby
petticoat, are as comfortable sounds to one of these rich citizens, as
the chink of their pieces of eight.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> This being granted to be the common design of human kind, it is
more than probable it is yours; therefore I'll leave you to the
prosecution of it.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Nay, good Jack, mine is but a mistress in embryo; the possession
of her is at least some days off; and till that time, thy company will
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'he'">be</ins> pleasant, and may be profitable to carry on the work. I would use
thee like an under kind of chemist, to blow coals; it will be time
enough for me to be alone, when I come to projection.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> You must excuse me, Frank; I have made an appointment at the
gaming-house.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> What to do there, I pr'ythee? To mis-spend that money, which kind
fortune intended for a mistress? Or to learn new oaths and curses to
carry into England? That is not it&mdash;I heard you were to
marry when you left home: Perhaps that may be still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
running in your head, and keep you virtuous.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Marriage, quotha! what, dost thou think I have been bred in the
deserts of Africa, or among the savages of America? Nay, if I had, I
must needs have known better things than so; the light of nature would
not have let me go so far astray.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Well, what think you of the Prado this evening?</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Pox upon't, 'tis worse than our contemplative Hyde-Park.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Oh, but we must submit to the custom of the country for
courtship: Whatever the means are, we are sure the end is still the same
in all places. But who are these?</p>

<span class="smcap">Jacintha</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Beatrix</span>, <i>their Woman, passing by</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Theo.</i> Do you see those strangers, sister, that eye us so earnestly?</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Yes, and I guess them to be feathers of the English ambassador's
train; for I think I saw them at the grand audience&mdash;and have the
strongest temptation in the world to talk to them: A mischief on this
modesty!</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> A mischief of this father of yours, that haunts you so.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> 'Tis very true, Beatrix; for though I am the younger sister, I
should have the grace to lay modesty first aside: However, sister, let
us pull up our veils, and give them an essay of our faces.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>They pull up their veils, and pull them down again.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Ah, Bellamy! undone, undone! Dost thou see those beauties?</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Pr'ythee, Wildblood, hold thy tongue, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
do not spoil my contemplation: I am undoing myself as fast as ever I can,
too.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> I must go to them.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Hold, madman! Dost thou not see their father? Hast thou a mind to
have our throats cut?</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> By a Hector of fourscore? Hang our throats: What! a lover, and
cautious?<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Is going towards them.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Come away, daughters; we shall be late
else.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Look you, they are on the wing already.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Pr'ythee, dear Frank, let's follow them: I long to know who they
are.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Let me alone, I'll dog them for you.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> I am glad on't; for my shoes so pinch me, I can scarce go a step
farther.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Cross the way there lives a shoemaker: Away quickly, that we may
not spoil our design.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Bel.</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Wild.</span></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> [<i>offers to go off.</i>] Now, friend! what's your business to
follow us?</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Noble Don, 'tis only to recommend my service to you: A certain
violent passion I have had for your worship, since the first moment that
I saw you.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> I never saw thee before, to my remembrance.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> No matter, sir; true love never stands upon ceremony.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Pr'ythee be gone, my saucy companion, or I'll clap an alguazil
upon thy heels: I tell thee I have no need of thy service.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Having no servant of your own, I cannot, in good manners, leave
you destitute.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> I'll beat thee, if thou followest me.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> I am your spaniel, sir; the more you beat
me, the better I'll wait on you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Let me entreat thee to be gone; the boys will hoot at me to see
me followed thus against my will.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Shall you and I concern ourselves for what the boys do, sir?
Pray do you hear the news at court?</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Pr'ythee, what's the news to thee or me?</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Will you be at the next <i>juego de cannas</i>?</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> If I think good.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Pray go on, sir; we can discourse as we walk together: And
whither were you now a-going, sir?</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> To the devil, I think.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> O, not this year or two, sir, by your age.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> My father was never so matched for talking in all his life
before; he who loves to hear nothing but himself: Pr'ythee, Beatrix,
stay behind, and see what this impudent Englishman would have.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> Sir, if you'll let my master go, I'll be his
pawn.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Well, sir, I kiss your hand, in hope to wait on you another
time.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Let us mend our pace, to get clear of him.</p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> If you do not, he'll be with you again, like Atalanta in the
fable, and make you drop another of your golden apples.<br />

<p><i>Beat.</i> How much good language is here thrown away, to make me betray my
ladies?</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> If you will discover nothing of them, let me discourse with you
a little.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> As little as you please.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> They are rich, I suppose?</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> Now you are talking of them again: But they are as rich,
as they are fair.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Then they have the Indies: Well, but their names, my sweet
mistress.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> Sweet servant, their names are&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Their names are&mdash;out with it boldly&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> A secret&mdash;not to be disclosed.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> A secret, say you? Nay, then, I conjure you, as you are a woman,
tell it me.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> Not a syllable.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Why, then, as you are a waiting-woman; as you are the sieve of
all your lady's secrets, tell it me.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> You lose your labour; nothing will strain through me.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Are you so well stopped in the bottom?</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> It was enjoined me strictly as a secret.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Was it enjoined thee strictly, and canst thou hold it? Nay,
then, thou art invincible: But, by that face, that more than ugly face,
which I suspect to be under thy veil, disclose it to me.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> By that face of thine, which is a natural visor, I will not tell
thee.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> By thy&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> No more swearing, I beseech you.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> That woman's worth little, that is not worth an oath: Well, get
thee gone; now I think on't, thou shalt not tell me.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> Shall I not? Who shall hinder me? They are Don Alonzo de
Ribera's daughters.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Out, out: I'll stop my ears.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> They live hard by, in the <i>Calle maior.</i></p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> O, infernal tongue&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> And are going to the next chapel with their father.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Wilt thou never have done tormenting me? In my conscience, anon
thou wilt blab out their names too.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> Their names are Theodosia and Jacintha.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> And where's your great secret now?</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> Now, I think, I am revenged on you, for running down my poor old
master.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Thou art not fully revenged, till thou hast told me thy own name
too.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> 'Tis Beatrix, at your service, sir; pray remember I wait on
them.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Now I have enough, I must be going.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> I perceive you are just like other men; when you have got your
ends, you care not how soon you are going. Farewell:&mdash;you'll be
constant to me?</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> If thy face, when I see it, do not give me occasion to be
otherwise.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> You shall take a sample, that you may praise it, when you see it
next.<br />

Theodosia and Jacintha, and they are going to their devotions in the

<h3>SCENE II.&mdash;<i>A Chapel.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Alonzo</span>, <span class="smcap">Theodosia</span>, <span class="smcap">Jacintha</span>, <span class="smcap">Beatrix</span>,
<i>other Ladies, and Cavaliers at their devotions.</i></p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> By that time you have told your beads, I'll be again with you.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exit.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Do you think the Englishmen will come after us?</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> Do you think they can stay from you?</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> For my part, I feel a certain qualm upon my heart, which makes me
believe I am breeding love to one of them.</p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> How, love, Jacintha! in so short a time? Cupid's arrow was well
feathered, to reach you so suddenly.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Faith, as good at first as at last, sister; 'tis a thing that
must be done, and therefore 'tis best dispatching it out o'the way.</p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> But you do not mean to tell him so, whom you love?</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Why should I keep myself and servant in pain, for that which may
be cured at a day's warning?</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> My lady tells you true, madam; long tedious courtship may be
proper for cold countries, where their frosts are long a thawing; but,
heaven be praised, we live in a warm climate.</p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> The truth is, in other countries they have opportunities of
courtship, which we have not; they are not mewed up with double locks
and grated windows; but may receive addresses at their leisure.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> But our love here is like our grass; if it be not mowed quickly,
'tis burnt up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Bellamy</span>, <span class="smcap">Wildblood</span>, and <span class="smcap">Maskall</span>: <i>They look about them.</i></p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> Yonder are your gallants; send you comfort of them: I am for my
devotions.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Now for my heart can I think of no other prayer, but only that
they may not mistake us. Why, sister, sister, will you pray? What injury
have I ever done you, that you should pray in my company? If your
servant Don Melchor were here, we should have you mind heaven as little
as the best of us.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> They are at a loss, madam; shall I put up my veil, that they may
take aim?</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> No, let them take their fortune in the dark: We shall see what
archers these English are.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Which are they, think'st thou?</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> There's no knowing them, they are all children of darkness.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> I'll be sworn they have one sign of godliness among them, there's
no distinction of persons here.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Pox o'this blind-man's-buff; they may be ashamed to provoke a
man thus, by their keeping themselves so close.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> You are for the youngest, you say; 'tis the eldest has smitten
me. And here I fix; if I am right, happy man be his dole.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>By</i> <span class="smcap">Theodosia.</span></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> I'll take my fortune here.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>By</i> <span class="smcap">Jacintha.</span></span><br />
Madam, I hope a stranger may take the liberty, without offence, to offer
his devotions by you?</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> That, sir, would interrupt mine, without being any advantage to
your own.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> My advantage, madam, is very evident; for the kind saint, to
whom you pray, may, by the neighbourhood, mistake my devotions for
yours.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> O, sir! our saints can better distinguish between the prayers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
of a Catholic and a Lutheran.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> I beseech you, madam, trouble not yourself for my religion; for,
though I am a heretic to the men of your country, to your ladies I am a
very zealous Catholic; and for fornication and adultery, I assure you I
hold with both churches.</p>

<p><i>Theo. to Bel.</i> Sir, if you will not be more devout, be at least more
civil; you see you are observed.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> And pray, madam, what do you think the lookers on imagine I am
employed about?</p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> I will not trouble myself to guess.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Why, by all circumstances, they must conclude that I am making
love to you; and, methinks, it were scarce civil to give the opinion of
so much good company the lie.</p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> If this were true, you would have little reason to thank them
for their divination.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Meaning, I should not be loved again?</p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> You have interpreted my riddle, and may take it for your pains.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Alonzo</span>, <i>and goes apart to his devotion.</i></p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> Madam, your father is returned.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> She has nettled me; would, I could be revenged on her!</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Do you see their father? Let us make as though we talked to one
another, that we may not be suspected.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> You have lost your Englishmen.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> No, no, 'tis but design, I warrant you: You shall see these
island cocks wheel about immediately.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>The English gather up close to them.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> Perhaps they thought they were observed.</p>

<p><i>Wild. to Bel.</i> Talk not of our country ladies: I declare myself for the
Spanish beauties.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Pr'ythee, tell me what thou canst find to doat on in these
Castilians?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Their wit and beauty.</p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> Now for our champion, St Jago, for Spain.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Faith, I can speak no such miracles of either; for their beauty,
'tis much as the Moors left it; not altogether so deep a black as the
true Ethiopian; a kind of beauty that is too civil to the lookers-on to
do them any mischief.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> This was your frowardness, that provoked him, sister.</p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> But they shall not carry it off so.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> As for their wit, you may judge it by their breeding, which is
commonly in a nunnery; where the want of mankind, while they are there,
makes them value the blessing ever after.</p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> Pr'ythee, dear Jacintha, tell me, what kind of creatures were
those we saw yesterday at the audience? Those, I mean, that looked so
like Frenchmen in their habits, but only became their apishness so much
worse.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Englishmen, I think, they called them.</p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> Cry you mercy; they were of your wild English, indeed; that is,
a kind of northern beast, that is taught its feats of activity in
Monsieurland; and, for doing them too lubberly, is laughed at all the
world over.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Wildblood, I perceive the women understand little of discourse;
their gallants do not use them to it: They get upon their jennets, and
prance before their ladies' windows; there the palfrey curvets and
bounds, and, in short, entertains them for his master.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> And this horseplay they call making love.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> Your father, madam&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Daughters! what cavaliers are those which were talking by
you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Englishmen, I believe, sir, at their devotions.&mdash;Cavalier,
would you would try to pray a little better than you have rallied.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Wild.</span></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Hang me if I put all my devotions out of order for you: I
remember I prayed but on Tuesday last, and my time comes not till
Tuesday next.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> You had as good pray, sir: she will not stir till you have: Say
any thing.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Fair lady, though I am not worthy of the least of your favours,
yet give me the happiness this evening to see you at your father's door,
that I may acquaint you with part of my sufferings.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Jac.</span></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Come, daughters, have you done?</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Immediately, sir.&mdash;Cavalier, I will not fail to be there at
the time appointed, if it be but to teach you more wit, henceforward,
than to engage your heart so lightly.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Wild.</span></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> I have engaged my heart with so much zeal and true devotion to
your divine beauty, that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> What means this cavalier?</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Some zealous ejaculation.</p>

<p><i>Alan.</i> May the saint hear him!</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> I'll answer for her.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exeunt Father and Daughters.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Now, Bellamy, what success?</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> I prayed to a more marble saint than that was in the shrine; but
you, it seems, have been successful.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> And so shalt thou; let me alone for both.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> If you'll undertake it, I'll make bold to indulge my love, and
within these two hours be a desperate inamorato. I feel I am coming
apace to it.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Faith, I can love at any time with a wish, at my rate: I give my
heart according to the old law of pawns, to be returned me before
sunset.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> I love only that I may keep my heart warm; for a man's a pool, if
love stir him not; and to bring it to that pass, I first resolve whom to
love, and presently after imagine I am in love: for a strong imagination
is required in a lover as much as in a witch.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> And is this all your receipt?</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> These are my principal ingredients; as for piques, jealousies,
duels, daggers, and halters, I let them alone to the vulgar.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Pr'ythee, let's round the street a little; till Maskall watches
for their woman.</p>

<h3>ACT II. SCENE I.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Wildblood</span>, <span class="smcap">Bellamy</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Maskall</span>.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Did you speak with her woman?</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Yes, but she was in haste, and bid me wait her hereabouts when
she returned.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Then you have discovered nothing more?</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Only, in general, that Donna Theodosia is engaged elsewhere; so
that all your courtship will be to no purpose&mdash;But for your
mistress, sir, [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Wild.</span>] she is waded out of her depth in love to you
already.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> That's very hard, when I am scarce knee-deep with her: 'Tis
true, I have given her hold of my heart; but, if she take not heed, it
will slip through her fingers.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> You are prince of the soil, sir, and may take your pleasure when
you please; but I am the eve to your holiday, and must fast for being
joined to you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Were I as thou art, I would content myself with having but one
fair flight at her, without wearying myself on the wing for a retrieve;
for, when all is done, the quarry is but a woman.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Thank you, sir, you would fly them both yourself; and while I
turn tail, we should have you come, gingling with your bells in the neck
of my partridge. Do you remember who encouraged me to love, and promised
me his assistance?</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Ay, while there was hope, Frank! while there was hope! but
there's no contending with one's destiny.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Nay, it may be I care as little for her as another man; but,
while she flies before me, I must follow: I can love a woman first with
ease; but if she begins to fly before me, I grow <i>opiniatre</i> as the
devil.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> What a secret have you found out? Why, 'tis the nature of all
mankind: We love to get our mistresses, and purr over them, as cats do
over mice, and let them go a little way; and all the pleasure is, to pat
them back again: But yours, I take it, Frank, is gone too far. Pr'ythee,
how long dost thou intend to love at this rate?</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Till the evil constellation be past over me: Yet, I believe, it
would hasten my recovery, if I knew whom she loved.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> You shall not be long without that satisfaction.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> 'St, the door opens; and two women are coming out.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> By their stature, they should be thy gracious mistress and
Beatrix.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Methinks you should know your cue then, and withdraw.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Well, I'll leave you to your fortune; but, if you come to close
fighting, I shall make bold to run in, and part you.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span><br />
<span class="rightalign">[<span class="smcap">Bellamy</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Maskall</span>, <i>withdrawing</i>.</span><br /></p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Yonder she comes, with full sails i'faith! I'll hail her amain,
for England.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Jacintha</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Beatrix</span>, <i>at the other end of the stage.</i></p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> You do love him then?</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Yes, most vehemently!</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> But set some bounds to your affection.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> None but fools confine their pleasure: What usurer ever thought
his coffers held too much? No, I'll give myself the swing, and love
without reserve. If I keep a passion, I'll not starve it in my service.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> But are you sure he will deserve this kindness?</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> I never trouble myself so long beforehand. Jealousies and
disquiets are the dregs of an amour; but I'll leave mine before I have
drawn it off so low. When it once grows troubled, I'll give vent to a
fresh draught.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> Yet it is but prudence to try him first; no pilot ventures on an
unknown coast without sounding.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Well, to satisfy thee, I am content; partly, too, because I find
a kind of pleasure in laying baits for him.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> The two great virtues of a lover are constancy and liberality;
if he possess those two, you may be happy in him.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Nay, if he be not lord and master of both those qualities, I
disown him&mdash;&mdash;But who goes there?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> He, I warrant you, madam; for his servant told me he was waiting
hereabout.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Watch the door; give me notice, if any
come.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> I'll secure you, madam.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Beat.</span></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Wild.</span>] What, have you laid an ambush
for me?</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Only to make a reprisal of my heart.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> 'Tis so wild, that the lady, who has it in her keeping, would be
glad she were well rid on't, it does so flutter about the cage. 'Tis a
mere Bajazet; and if it be not let out the sooner, will beat out its
brains against the grates.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> I am afraid the lady has not fed it, and 'tis wild for hunger.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Or, perhaps it wants company; shall she put another to it?</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Ay; but then it were best to trust them out of the cage
together; let them hop about at liberty.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> But, if they should lose one another in the wide world!</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> They'll meet at night, I warrant them.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> But is not your heart of the nature of those birds, that breed in
one country, and go to winter in another?</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Suppose it does so; yet, I take my mate along with me. And now,
to leave our parables, and speak in the language of the vulgar, what
think you of a voyage to merry England?</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Just as Æsop's frog did, of leaping into a deep well in a
drought: If he ventured the leap, there might be water; but, if there
were no water, how should he get out again?</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Faith, we live in a good honest country, where we are content
with our old vices; partly because we want wit to invent more new.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
A colony of Spaniards, or spiritual Italians, planted among us, would
make us much more racy. 'Tis, true, our variety is not much; but, to
speak nobly of our way of living, 'tis like that of the sun, which
rises, and looks upon the same thing he saw yesterday, and goes to bed
again.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> But I hear your women live most blessedly; there is no such thing
as jealousy among the husbands; if any man has horns, he bears them as
loftily as a stag, and as inoffensively.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> All this, I hope, gives you no ill character of the country?</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> But what need we go into another climate? as our love was born
here, so let it live and die here, and be honestly buried in its native
country.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Faith, agreed with all my heart. For I am none of those
unreasonable lovers, that propose to themselves the loving to eternity.
The truth is, a month is commonly my stint; but, in that month, I love
so dreadfully, that it is after a twelve-month's rate of common love.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Or, would not a fortnight serve our turn? for, in troth, a month
looks somewhat dismally; 'tis a whole Egyptian year. If a moon changes
in my love, I shall think my Cupid grown dull, or fallen into an
apoplexy.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Well, I pray heaven we both get off as clear as we imagine; for
my part, I like your humour so damnably well, that I fear I am in for a
week longer than I proposed: I am half afraid your Spanish planet and my
English one have been acquainted, and have found out some by-room or
other in the twelve houses: I wish they have been honourable.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> The best way for both were to take up in time; yet I am afraid
our forces are engaged so far, that we must make a battle on't.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
What think you of disobliging one another from this day forward; and
shewing all our ill humours at the first, which lovers use to keep as a
reserve, till they are married?</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Or let us encourage one another to a breach, by the dangers of
possession: I have a song to that purpose.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Pray let me hear it: I hope it will go to the tune of one of our
<i>Passa-calles.</i></p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Believe it, cavalier, you are a dangerous person: Do you hold
forth your gifts, in hopes to make me love you less?</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> They would signify little, if we were once married: Those
gaieties are all nipt and frost-bitten in the marriage-bed, i'faith.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> I am sorry to hear 'tis so cold a place: But
'tis all one to us, who do not mean to trouble it. The truth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
is, your humour pleases me exceedingly; how long it will do so, I know
not; but so long as it does, I am resolved to give myself the content of
seeing you. For, if I should once constrain myself, I might fall in love
in good earnest: But I have stayed too long with you, and would be loth
to surfeit you at first.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Surfeit me madam? why, you have but tantalized me all this
while!</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> What would you have?</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> A hand, or lip, or any thing that you can spare; when you have
conjured up a spirit, he must have some employment, or he'll tear you
apieces.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Well, here's my picture, to help your contemplation in my
absence.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> You have already the original of mine: But some revenge you must
allow me: A locket of diamonds, or some such trifle, the next time I
kiss your hand.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Fie, fie! you do not think me mercenary? Yet, now I think on't,
I'll put you into our Spanish mode of love: Our ladies here use to be
the bankers of their servants, and to have their gold in keeping.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> This is the least trial you could have made of me: I have some
three hundred pistoles by me; those I'll send by my servant.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Confess freely, you mistrust me: But if you find the least qualm
about your gold, pray keep it for a cordial.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> The cordial must be applied to the heart, and mine's with you,
madam. Well; I say no more; but these are dangerous beginnings for
holding on: I find my month will have more than one-and-thirty days
in't.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Beatrix</span>, <i>running</i>.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> Madam, your father calls in haste for you, and is looking for
you about the house.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Adieu, servant; be a good manager of your stock of love, that it
may hold out your month; I am afraid you'll waste so much of it before
to-morrow night, that you'll shine but with a quarter moon upon me.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> It shall be a crescent.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Wild.</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Jac.</span> <i>severally.</i></span><br />
<span class="rightalign">[<span class="smcap">Beatrix</span> <i>is going, and</i> <span class="smcap">Maskall</span> <i>runs and
stops her.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Pay your ransom; you are my prisoner.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> What! do you fight after the French fashion; take towns before
you declare a war?</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> I shall be glad to imitate them so far, to be in the middle of
the country before you could resist me.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> Well, what composition, monsieur?</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Deliver up your lady's secret; what makes her so cruel to my
master?</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> Which of my ladies, and which of your masters? For, I suppose,
we are factors for both of them.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Your eldest lady, Theodosia.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> How dare you press your mistress to an inconvenience?</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> My mistress? I understand not that language; the fortune of the
valet ever follows that of the master; and his is desperate: if his fate
were altered for the better, I should not care if I ventured upon you
for the worse.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> I have told you already, Donna Theodosia loves another.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Has he no name?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> Let it suffice, he is born noble, though without a fortune.
His poverty makes him conceal his love from her father; but she sees him
every night in private; and, to blind the world, about a fortnight ago
he took a solemn leave of her, as if he were going into Flanders: In the
mean time, he lodges at the house of Don Lopez de Gamboa; and is himself
called Don Melchor de Guzman.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Don Melchor de Guzman! O heavens!</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> What amazes you?</p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> [<i>Within.</i>] Why, Beatrix, where are you?</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> You hear I am called.&mdash;Adieu; and be sure you keep my
counsel.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Come, sir, you see the coast is clear.
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Beat.</span></span></p>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Bellamy</span>.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Clear, dost thou say? No, 'tis full of rocks and quicksands: Yet
nothing vexes me so much, as that she is in love with such a poor rogue.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> But that she should lodge privately in the same house with us!
'twas oddly contrived of fortune.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Hang him, rogue! methinks I see him, perching, like an owl, by
day, and not daring to flutter out till moonlight. The rascal invents
love, and brews his compliments all day, and broaches them at night;
just as some of our dry wits do their stories, before they come into
company. Well, if I could be revenged on either of them!</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Here she comes again, with Beatrix; but, good sir, moderate your
passion.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Theodosia</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Beatrix</span>.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Nay, madam; you are known; and must not pass till I have spoken
with you.<br />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> This rudeness to a person of my quality may cost you dear. Pray,
when did I give you encouragement for so much familiarity?</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> When you scorned me in the chapel.</p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> The truth is, I denied you as heartily as I could, that I might
not be twice troubled with you.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Yet you have not this aversion for all the world: However, I was
in hope, though the day frowned, the night might prove as propitious to
me as it is to others.</p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> I have now a quarrel both to the sun and moon, because I have
seen you both by their lights.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Spare the moon, I beseech you, madam; she is a very trusty planet
to you.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> O, Maskall, you have ruined me!</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Dear sir, hold yet!</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Away!</p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> Pray, sir, expound your meaning; for, I confess, I am in the
dark.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Methinks you should discover it by moonlight. Or, if you would
have me speak clearer to you, give me leave to wait on you at a midnight
assignation; and, that it may not be discovered, I'll feign a voyage
beyond sea, as if I were going a captaining to Flanders.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> A pox on his memory! he has not forgot one syllable!</p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> Ah, Beatrix! you have betrayed and sold me!</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> You have betrayed and sold yourself, madam, by your own rashness
to confess it; heaven knows I have served you but too faithfully.</p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> Peace, impudence! and see my face no more!</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Do you know what work you have made, sir?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Let her see what she has got by slighting me.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> You had best let Beatrix be turned away for me to keep: If you
do, I know whose purse shall pay for't.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> That's a curse I never thought on: Cast about quickly, and save
all yet. Range, quest, and spring a lie immediately!</p>

<p><i>Theo. [To</i> <span class="smcap">Beat.</span>] Never importune me farther;
you shall go; there's no removing me.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> Well; this is ever the reward of innocence&mdash;&mdash;<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Going.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Stay, guiltless virgin, stay; thou shalt
not go!</p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> Why, who should hinder it?</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> That will I, in the name of truth,&mdash;if this hard-bound lie
would but come from me.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside.</i></span><br />
Madam, I must tell you it lies in my power to appease this tempest with
one word.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> Would it were come once!</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Nay, sir, 'tis all one to me, if you turn me away upon't; I can
hold no longer.</p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> What does the fellow mean?</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> For all your noddings, and your mathematical grimaces&mdash;in
short, madam, my master has been conversing with the planets; and from
them has had the knowledge of your affairs.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> This rogue amazes me!</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> I care not, sir, I am for truth; that will shame you, and all
your devils: In short, madam, this master of mine, that stands before
you, without a word to say for himself, so like an oaf, as I might say,
with reverence to him&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> The rascal makes me mad!</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Is the greatest astrologer in Christendom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> Your master an astrologer?</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> A most profound one.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Why, you dog, you do not consider what an improbable lie this is;
which, you know, I can never make good! Disgorge it, you cormorant! or
I'll pinch your throat out.&mdash;&mdash;<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Takes him by the throat.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> 'Tis all in vain, sir! you are, and shall be an astrologer,
whatever I suffer; you know all things; see into all things; foretell
all things; and if you pinch more truth out of me, I will confess you
are a conjurer.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> How, sirrah! a conjurer?</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> I mean, sir, the devil is in your fingers: Own it&mdash;you had
best, sir, and do not provoke me farther. [<i>While he is speaking</i>, <span
class="smcap">Bellamy</span> <i>stops his mouth by fits.</i>] What! did not I see
you an hour ago turning over a great folio, with strange figures in it,
and then muttering to yourself, like any poet; and then naming Theodosia,
and then staring up in the sky, and then poring upon the ground; so
that, betwixt God and the devil, madam, he came to know your love.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Madam, if ever I knew the least term in astrology, I am the
arrantest son of a whore breathing.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> O, sir, for that matter, you shall excuse my lady: Nay, hide
your talents if you can, sir.</p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> The more you pretend ignorance, the more
we are resolved to believe you skilful.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> You'll hold your tongue yet.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mask.</span></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> You shall never make me hold my tongue, except you conjure me to
silence: What! did you not call me to look into a crystal, and there
shewed me a fair garden, and a Spaniard stalking in his narrow
breeches, and walking underneath a window? I should know him again
amongst a thousand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> Don Melchor, in my conscience, madam.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> This rogue will invent more stories of me, than e'er were
fathered upon Lilly!</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Will you confess, then? do you think I'll stain my honour to
swallow a lie for you?</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Well, a pox on you, I am an astrologer.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> O, are you so, sir?</p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> I hope then, learned sir, as you have been curious in enquiring
into my secrets, you will be so much a cavalier as to conceal them.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> You need not doubt me, madam; I am more in your power than you
can be in mine: Besides, if I were once known in town, the next thing,
for aught I know, would be to bring me before the fathers of the
inquisition.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> Well, madam, what do you think of me now? I have betrayed you, I
have sold you! how can you ever make me amends for this imputation? I
did not think you could have used me so&mdash;&mdash;<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Cries, and claps her hands at her.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> Nay, pr'ythee, Beatrix, do not cry; I'll leave off my new gown
to-morrow, and thou shalt have it.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> No, I'll cry eternally! you have taken away my good name from
me; and you can never make me recompence&mdash;&mdash;except you give me
your new gorget too.</p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> No more words; thou shalt have it, girl.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> O, madam, your father has surprised us!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Don Alonzo</span>, <i>and frowns</i>.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Then, I'll begone, to avoid suspicion.</p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> By your favour, sir, you shall stay a little; the happiness of
so rare an acquaintance ought to be cherished on my side by a longer
conversation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Theodosia, what business have you with this cavalier?</p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> That, sir, which will make you as ambitious of being known to
him as I have been: Under the habit of a gallant, he conceals the
greatest astrologer this day living.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> You amaze me, daughter!</p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> For my own part, I have been consulting with him about some
particulars of my fortunes past and future; both which he has resolved
me with that admirable knowledge&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Yes, faith, sir, I was foretelling her of a disaster that
severely threatened her: And&mdash;one thing I foresee already by my
stars, that I must bear up boldly, or I am lost.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Bel.</span>] Never fear him, sir; he's an ignorant fellow, and
credulous, I warrant him.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Daughter, be not too confident in your belief; there's nothing
more uncertain than the old prophecies of these Nostradamusses; but of
what nature was the question which you asked him?</p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> What should be my fortune in marriage.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> And, pray, what did you answer, sir?</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> I answered her the truth, that she is in danger of marrying a
gentleman without a fortune.</p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> And this, sir, has put me in such a fright&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Never trouble yourself about it, daughter; follow my advice, and
I warrant you a rich husband.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> But the stars say she shall not follow your advice: If it happens
otherwise, I'll burn my folio volumes, and my manuscripts too, I assure
you that, sir.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Be not too confident, young man; I know somewhat in astrology
myself; for, in my younger years, I studied it; and, though I say it,
made some small proficiency in it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Marry, heaven forbid!&mdash;&mdash;<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> And I could only find it was no way demonstrative, but
altogether fallacious.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> On what a rock have we split ourselves!</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Now my ignorance will certainly come out!</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> Sir, remember you are old and crazy, sir; and if the evening air
should take you&mdash;&mdash;beseech you, sir, retire.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Knowledge is to be preferred before health; I must needs discuss
a point with this learned cavalier, concerning a difficult question in
that art, which almost gravels me.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> How I sweat for him, Beatrix, and myself too, who have brought
him into this <i>præmunire</i>!</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> You must be impudent; for our old man will stick like a burr to
you, now he's in a dispute.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> What judgment may a man reasonably form from the trine aspect of
the two infortunes in angular houses?</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> That's a matter of nothing, sir; I'll turn my man loose to you
for such a question.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Puts</i> <span class="smcap">Maskall</span> <i>forward.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Come on, sir. I am the quærent.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Meaning me, sir! I vow to God, and your worship knows it, I
never made that science my study in the least, sir.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> The gleanings of mine are enough for that: Why, you impudent
rogue you, hold forth your gifts, or I'll&mdash;What a devil, must I be
pestered with every trivial question, when there's not a master in town
of any science, but has his usher for these mean offices?</p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> Try him in some deeper question, sir; you see he will not put
himself forth for this.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Then I'll be more abstruse with him: What think you, sir, of the
taking Hyleg? or of the best way of rectification for a nativity? Have
you been conversant in the Centiloquium of Trismegistus: What think you
of Mars in the tenth, when 'tis his own house, or of Jupiter
configurated with malevolent planets?</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> I thought what your skill was! to answer your question in two
words, Mars rules over the martial, and Jupiter over the jovial; and so
of the rest, sir.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> This every school-boy could have told me.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Why then you must not ask such school-boy's questions. But your
carcase, sirrah, shall pay for this.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Maskall.</span></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> You seem not to understand the terms, sir.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> By your favour, sir, I know there are five of them; do not I know
your Michaelmas, your Hillary, your Easter, your Trinity, and your Long
Vocation term, sir?</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> I do not understand a word of this jargon.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> It may be not, sir; I believe the terms are not the same in Spain
they are in England.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Did one ever hear so impudent an ignorance?</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> The terms of art are the same every where.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Tell me that! you are an old man, and they are altered since you
studied them.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> That may be, I must confess; however, if you please to discourse
something of the art to me, you shall find me an apt scholar.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Is your business very pressing?</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> It is, I assure you, sir.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> I am very sorry, for I should have instructed you in such rare
secrets! I have no fault, but that I am too communicative.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> I'll dispatch my business, and return immediately; come away,

<p><i>Bel.</i> A devil on his learning; he had brought me to my last legs; I was
fighting as low as ever was 'Squire Widdrington.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Who would have suspected it from that wicked elder?</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Suspected it? why 'twas palpable from his very physiognomy; he
looks like Haly, and the spirit Fircue in the fortune-book.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Wildblood</span>.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> How now, Bellamy! in wrath! pr'ythee, what's the matter?</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> The story is too long to tell you; but this rogue here has made
me pass for an arrant fortune-teller.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> If I had not, I am sure he must have passed for an arrant mad
man; he had discovered, in a rage, all that Beatrix had confessed to me
concerning her mistress's love; and I had no other way to bring him off,
but to say he knew it by the planets.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> And art thou such an oaf to be vexed at this? as the adventure
may be managed, it may make the most pleasant one in all the carnival.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Death! I shall have all Madrid about me in these two days.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Nay, all Spain, i'faith, as fast as I can divulge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
thee: Not a ship shall pass out from any port, but shall ask thee for a
wind; thou shalt have all the trade of Lapland within a month.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> And do you think it reasonable for me to stand defendant to all
the impertinent questions, that the town can ask me?</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Thou shalt do't, boy: Pox on thee, thou dost not know thine own
happiness; thou wilt have the ladies come to thee; and if thou dost not
fit them with fortunes, thou art bewitched.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Sir, 'tis the easiest thing in nature; you need but speak
doubtfully, or keep yourself in general terms, and, for the most part,
tell good rather than bad fortune.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> And if at any time thou venturest at particulars, have an
evasion ready like Lilly; as thus,&mdash;It will infallibly happen, if
our sins hinder not.&mdash;I would undertake, with one of his almanacks,
to give very good content to all Christendom, and what good luck fell
not out in one kingdom, should in another.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> The pleasure on't will be to see how all his customers will
contribute to their own deceiving; and verily believe he told them that,
which they told him.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Umph! now I begin to taste it; I am like the drunken tinker in
the play, a great prince, and never knew it.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> A great prince! a great Turk; we shall have thee, within these
two days, do grace to the ladies, by throwing out a handkerchief; 'life,
I could feast upon thy fragments.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> If the women come, you shall be sure to help me to undergo the
burden; for, though you make me an astronomer, I am no Atlas, to bear
all upon my back. But who are these?</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter Musicians, with disguises; and some in their hands.</i></p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> You know the men, if their masking habits were off; they are the
music of our ambassador's retinue. My project is to give our mistress a
serenade, this being the last evening of the carnival; and, to prevent
discovery, here are disguises for us too.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> 'Tis very well; come, Maskall, help on with them, while they tune
their instruments.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> [<i>Rising.</i>] So all's past, and I am safe: A pox on these

valours and magnanimities. When I go a-serenading again with them, I'll

<p><i>Lop.</i> The same; and, by yours, you should belong to my two English
guests. Did you hear no tumult hereabouts?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> I heard a clashing of swords, and men a fighting.</p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> I had my share in't; but how came you here?</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> I came hither by my master's order, to see if you were in any
danger.</p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> But how could he imagine I was in any?</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> 'Tis all one for that, sir; he knew it, by&mdash;&mdash;Heaven,
what was I a going to say! I had like to have discovered all!</p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> I find there is some secret in't, and you dare not trust me.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> If you will swear on your honour to be very secret, I will tell
you.</p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> As I am a cavalier, and by my beard, I will.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Then, in few words, he knew it by astrology, or magic.</p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> You amaze me! Is he conversant in the occult sciences?</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Most profoundly.</p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> I always thought him an extraordinary person; but I could never
imagine his head lay that way.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> He shewed me yesterday, in a glass, a lady's maid at London,
whom I well knew; and with whom I used to converse on a pallet in a
drawing-room, while he was paying his devotions to her lady in the
bed-chamber.</p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> Lord, what a treasure for a state were here! and how much might
we save by this man, in foreign intelligence!</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> And just now he shewed me, how you were assaulted in the dark by
foreigners.</p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> Could you guess what countrymen?</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> I imagined them to be Italians.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> Not unlikely; for they played most furiously at our backsides.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> I will return to my master with the good news of your safety;
but once again be secret; or disclose it to none but friends.&mdash;So,
there's one woodcock more in the springe.&mdash;&mdash;<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exit.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> Yes, I will be very secret; for I will tell it only to one
person; but she is a woman. I will to Aurelia, and acquaint her with the
skill of this rare artist: She is curious, as all women are; and, 'tis
probable, will desire to look into the glass to see Don Melchor, whom
she believes absent; so that by this means, without breaking my oath to
him, he will be discovered to be in town. Then his intrigue with
Theodosia will come to light too, for which Aurelia will, I hope,
discard him, and receive me. I will about it instantly:</p>

<h3>ACT III. SCENE I.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Bellamy</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Maskall</span>.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Then, they were certainly Don Lopez and Don Melchor, with whom we
fought.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> And when you met Lopez, he swallowed all you told him?</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> As greedily, as if it had been a new saint's miracle.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> I see 'twill spread.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> And the fame of it will be of use to you in your next amour; for
the women, you know, run mad after fortune-tellers and preachers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> But for all my bragging, this amour is not yet worn off. I find
constancy, and once a night, come naturally upon a man towards thirty;
only we set a face on't, and call ourselves inconstant for our
reputation.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> But what say the stars, sir?</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> They move faster than you imagine; for I have got me an argol,
and an English almanack, by help of which, in one half hour, I have
learned to cant with an indifferent good grace: Conjunction, opposition,
trine, square, and sextile, are now no longer bugbears to me, I thank my
stars for't.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Wildblood.</span></p>

<p>Monsieur Wildblood, in good time! What, you have been taking pains, too,
to divulge my talent?</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> So successfully, that shortly there will be no talk in town, but
of you only: Another miracle or two, and a sharp sword, and you stand
fair for a new prophet.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> But where did you begin to blow the trumpet?</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> In the gaming-house, where I found most of the town-wits; the
prose-wits playing, and the verse-wits rooking.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> All sorts of gamesters are so superstitious, that I need not
doubt of my reception there.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> From thence I went to the latter end of a comedy, and there
whispered it to the next man I knew, who had a woman by him.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Nay, then, it went like a train of powder, if once they had it
by the end.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Like a squib upon a line, i'faith; it ran through one row, and
came back upon me in the next. At my going out I met a knot of
Spaniards, who were formally listening to one, who was relating it; but
he told the story so ridiculously, with his marginal notes upon it,
that I was forced to contradict him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> 'Twas discreetly done.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Ay, for you, but not for me: What, says he, must such Boracho's
as you take upon you to vilify a man of science? I tell you, he's of my
intimate acquaintance, and I have known him long for a prodigious
person.&mdash;When I saw my Don so fierce, I thought it not wisdom to
quarrel for so slight a matter as your reputation, and so withdrew.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> A pox of your success! now shall I have my chamber besieged
to-morrow morning: There will be no stirring out for me; but I must be
fain to take up their questions in a cleft-cane, or a begging-box, as
they do charity in prisons.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Faith, I cannot help what your learning has brought you to. Go
in and study; I foresee you will have but few holidays: In the mean
time, I'll not fail to give the world an account of your endowments.
Farewell: I'll to the gaming-house.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Wild.</span></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> O, sir, here is the rarest adventure, and, which is more, come
home to you!</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> What is it?</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> A fair lady, and her woman, wait in the outer room to speak with
you.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> But how know you she is fair?</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Her woman plucked up her veil when she spoke to me; so that
having seen her this evening, I know her mistress to be Donna Aurelia,
cousin to your mistress Theodosia, and who lodges in the same house with
her: She wants a star or two, I warrant you.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> My whole constellation is at her service:
But what is she for a woman?</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Fair enough, as Beatrix has told me; but sufficiently
impertinent. She is one of those ladies, who make ten visits in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
afternoon; and entertain her they see, with speaking ill of the last,
from whom they parted: In few words, she is one of the greatest
coquettes in Madrid; and to shew she is one, she cannot speak ten words
without some affected phrase that is in fashion.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> For my part, I can suffer any impertinence from a woman, provided
she be handsome: My business is with her beauty, not with her morals;
let her confessor look to them.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> I wonder what she has to say to you?</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> I know not; but I sweat for fear I should be gravelled.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Venture out of your depth, and plunge boldly, sir; I warrant you
will swim.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Do not leave me, I charge you; but when I look mournfully upon
you, help me out.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Aurelia</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Camilla</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Here they are already.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<span class="smcap">Aur.</span> <i>plucks up her veil.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> How am I dressed to-night, Camilla? is nothing disordered in my
head?</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Not the least hair, madam.</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> No! let me see: Give me the counsellor of the graces.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> The counsellor of the graces, madam!</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> My glass, I mean: What, will you never be so spiritual as to
understand refined language?</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Madam!</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> Madam me no madam, but learn to retrench your words; and say
ma'am; as, yes ma'am, and no ma'am, as other ladies' women do. Madam!
'tis a year in pronouncing.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Pardon me, madam.</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> Yet again, ignorance! Par-don, madam! fie, fie, what a
superfluity is there, and how much sweeter the cadence is&mdash;parn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
me, ma'am! and for your ladyship, your la'ship.&mdash;Out upon't, what a
furious indigence of ribbands is here upon my head! This dress is a
libel to my beauty; a mere lampoon. Would any one, that had the least
revenue of common sense, have done this?</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Ma'am, the cavalier approaches your la'ship.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> to <i>Mask.</i> Maskall, pump the woman; and see if you can discover
any thing to save my credit.</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> Out upon it! now I should speak, I want assurance.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Madam, I was told you meant to honour me with your commands.</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> I believe, sir, you wonder at my confidence in this visit; but I
may be excused for waving a little modesty, to know the only person of
the age.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> I wish my skill were more, to serve you, madam.</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> Sir, you are an unfit judge of your own merits: For my own part,
I confess, I have a furious inclination for the occult sciences; but at
present, 'tis my misfortune&mdash;&mdash;<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Sighs.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> But why that sigh, madam?</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> You might spare me the shame of telling you; since I am sure you
can divine my thoughts: I will, therefore, tell you nothing.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> What the devil will become of me now!<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> You may give me an essay of your science, by declaring to me the
secret of my thoughts.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> If I know your thoughts, madam, 'tis in vain for you to disguise
them to me: Therefore, as you tender your own satisfaction, lay them
open without bashfulness.</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> I beseech you let us pass over that chapter; for I am shame-faced
to the last point. Since, therefore, I cannot put off my modesty,
succour it, and tell me what I think.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Madam, madam, that bashfulness must be laid aside: Not but that I
know your business perfectly; and will, if you please, unfold it to you
all immediately.</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> Favour me so far, I beseech you, sir; for I furiously desire it.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> But then I must call up before you a most dreadful spirit, with
head upon head, and horns upon horns: Therefore, consider how you can
endure it.</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> This is furiously furious; but rather than fail of my
expectances, I'll try my assurance.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Well then, I find you will force me to this unlawful, and
abominable act of conjuration: Remember the sin is yours too.</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> I espouse the crime also.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> I see, when a woman has a mind to't, she'll never boggle at a
sin. Pox on her, what shall I do? [<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;Well, I'll tell you
your thoughts, madam; but after that expect no farther service from me;
for 'tis your confidence must make my art successful.&mdash;&mdash;Well,
you are obstinate, then; I must tell you your thoughts?</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> Hold, hold, sir; I am content to pass over that chapter, rather
than be deprived of your assistance.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> 'Tis very well; what need these circumstances between us two?
Confess freely; is not love your business?</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> You have touched me to the quick, sir.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Look you there! you see I knew it; nay, I'll tell you more, 'tis
a man you love.</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> O prodigious science! I confess I love a man most furiously, to
the last point, sir.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Now proceed, lady, your way is open; I am resolved, I'll not tell
you a word farther.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> Well then, since I must acquaint you with what you know much
better than myself, I will tell you. I loved a cavalier, who was noble,
young, and handsome; this gentleman is since gone for Flanders; now
whether he has preserved his passion inviolate, or not, is that which
causes my inquietude.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Trouble not yourself, madam; he's as constant as a romance hero.</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> Sir, your good news has ravished me most furiously; but that I
may have a confirmation of it, I beg only, that you would lay your
commands upon his genius, or idea, to appear to me this night, that I
may have my sentence from his mouth. This, sir, I know is a slight
effect of your science, and yet will infinitely oblige me.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> What the devil does she call a slight effect!
[<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;Why, lady, do you consider what you say? you desire me
to shew you a man, whom yourself confess to be in Flanders.</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> To view him in a glass is nothing; I would speak with him in
person, I mean his idea, sir.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Ay, but, madam, there is a vast sea betwixt us and Flanders; and
water is an enemy to conjuration. A witch's horse, you know, when he
enters into water, returns into a bottle of hay again.</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> But, sir, I am not so ill a geographer, or, to speak more
properly, a chorographer, as not to know there is a passage by land from
hence to Flanders.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> That's true, madam; but magic works in a direct line. Why should
you think the devil such an ass to go about? 'Gad, he'll not stir a step
out of his road for you, or any man.</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> Yes, for a lady, sir; I hope he's a person that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
wants not that civility for a lady; especially a spirit that has the
honour to belong to you, sir.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> For that matter, he's your servant, madam; but his education has
been in the fire, and he's naturally an enemy to water, I assure you.</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> I beg his pardon, for forgetting his antipathy; but it imports
not much, sir; for I have lately received a letter from my servant, that
he is yet in Spain, and stays for a wind in St Sebastian's.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Now I am lost, past all redemption.&mdash;Maskall, must you be
smickering after wenches, while I am in calamity?<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> It must be he, I'll venture on't. [<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;Alas, sir, I
was complaining to myself of the condition of poor Don Melchor, who, you
know, is wind-bound at St Sebastian's.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Why, you impudent villain, must you offer to name him publicly,
when I have taken so much care to conceal him all this while?</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> Mitigate your displeasure, I beseech you; and, without making
farther testimony of it, gratify my expectances.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Well, madam, since the sea hinders not, you shall have your
desire. Look upon me with a fixed eye&mdash;&mdash;so&mdash;&mdash;or a
little more amorously, if you please&mdash;&mdash;good. Now favour me
with your hand.</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> Is it absolutely necessary you should press my hand thus?</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Furiously necessary, I assure you, madam; for now I take
possession of it in the name of the idea of Don Melchor. Now, madam, I
am farther to desire of you, to write a note to his genius, wherein you
desire him to appear, and this we men of art call a compact with the
ideas.</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> I tremble furiously.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Give me your hand, I'll guide it.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>They write.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Mask. to Cam.</i> Now, lady mine, what think you
of my master?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> I think, I would not serve him for the world: Nay, if he can know
our thoughts by looking on us, we women are hypocrites to little
purpose.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> He can do that and more; for, by casting his eyes but once upon
them, he knows whether they are maids, better than a whole jury of
mid-wives.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Now heaven defend me from him!</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> He has a certain small familiar, which he carries still about
him, that never fails to make discovery.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> See, they have done writing; not a word more, for fear he knows
my voice.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> One thing I had forgot, madam; you must subscribe your name to
it.</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> There 'tis; farewell, cavalier, keep your promise, for I expect
it furiously.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> If he sees me, I am undone.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Hiding her face.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Camilla!</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> [<i>starts and shrieks.</i>] Ah, he has found me; I am ruined!</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> You hide your face in vain; for I see into your heart.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Then, sweet sir, have pity on my frailty; for if my lady has the
least inkling of what we did last night, the poor coachman will be
turned away.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exit after her Lady.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Well, sir, how like you your new profession?</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Would I were well quit on't; I sweat all over.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> But what faint-hearted devils yours are, that will not go by
water! Are they all Lancashire devils, of the brood of Tybert and
Grimalkin, that they dare not wet their feet?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Mine are honest land devils, good plain foot-posts, that beat
upon the hoof for me: But to save their labour, here take this, and in
some disguise deliver it to Don Melchor.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> I'll serve it upon him within this hour, when he sallies out to
his assignation with Theodosia: 'Tis but counterfeiting my voice a
little; for he cannot know me in the dark. But let me see, what are the
words?</p>

<blockquote><p>Reads.] <i>Don Melchor, if the magic of love have any power upon your
spirit, I conjure you to appear this night before me: You may guess the
greatness of my passion, since it has forced me to have recourse to art;
but no shape which resembles you can fright</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 27em;"><span class="smcap">Aurelia.</span></span></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Well, I am glad there's one point gained; for, by this means, he
will be hindered to-night from entertaining Theodosia.&mdash;Pox on him,
is he here again?</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter Don</i> <span class="smcap">Alonzo</span>.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Cavalier Inglis, I have been seeking you: I have a present in my
pocket for you; read it by your art, and take it.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> That I could do easily: But, to shew you I am generous, I'll none
of your present; do you think I am mercenary?</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> I know you will say now 'tis some astrological question; and so
'tis perhaps.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Ay, 'tis the devil of a question, without dispute.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> No, 'tis within dispute: 'Tis a certain difficulty in the art;
a problem, which you and I will discuss, with the arguments on both
sides.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> At this time I am not problematically given; I have a humour of
complaisance upon me, and will contradict no man.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> We'll but discuss a little.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> By your favour, I'll not discuss; for I see by the stars, that,
if I dispute to-day, I am infallibly threatened to be thought ignorant
all my life after.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Well then, we'll but cast an eye together upon my eldest
daughter's nativity.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Nativity!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> I know what you would say now, that there wants the table of
direction for the five hylegiacalls; the ascendant, <i>medium coeli</i>, sun,
moon, and stars: But we'll take it as it is.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Never tell me that, sir&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> I know what you would say again, sir&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> 'Tis well you do, for I'll be sworn I do not.&mdash;&mdash;<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> You would say, sir&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> I say, sir, there is no doing without the sun and moon, and all
that, sir; and so you may make use of your paper for your occasions.
Come to a man of art without the sun and moon, and all that,
sir&mdash;&mdash;<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Tears it.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> 'Tis no matter; this shall break no squares betwixt us.
[<i>Gathers up the torn papers.</i>] I know what you would say now, that men
of parts are always choleric; I know it by myself, sir.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>He goes to match the papers.</i></span><br /></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter Don</i> <span class="smcap">Lopez</span>.</p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> Don Alonzo in my house! this is a most happy opportunity to put
my other design in execution; for, if I can persuade him to bestow his
daughter on Don Melchor, I shall serve my friend, though against his
will; and, when Aurelia sees she cannot be his, perhaps she will accept
my love.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> I warrant you, sir, 'tis all pieced right, both top, sides, and
bottom; for, look you, sir, here was Aldeboran, and there Cor
Scorpii&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> Don Alonzo, I am happy to see you under my roof; and shall take
it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> I know what you would say, sir; that
though I am your neighbour, this is the first time I
have been here.&mdash;[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Bellamy</span>.] But, come, sir,
by Don Lopez' permission, let us return to our nativity.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Would thou wert there, in thy mother's belly again!<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> But, sennor&mdash;&mdash;<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Alonzo.</span></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> It needs not, sennor; I'll suppose your compliment; you would
say, that your house, and all things in it, are at my service.&mdash;But
let us proceed, without this interruption.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> By no means, sir; this cavalier is come on purpose to perform the
civilities of his house to you.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> But, good sir&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> I know what you would say, sir.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Bellamy</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Maskall.</span></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> No matter, let him go, sir. I have long desired this opportunity,
to move a suit to you in the behalf of a friend of mine, if you please
to allow me the hearing of it.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> With all my heart, sir.</p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> He is a person of worth and virtue, and is infinitely ambitious
of the honour&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Of being known to me; I understand you, sir.</p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> If you will please to favour me with your patience, which I beg
of you a second time.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> I am dumb, sir.</p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> This cavalier, of whom I was speaking, is in love&mdash;&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Satisfy yourself, sir, I'll not interrupt you.</p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> Sir, I am satisfied of your promise.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> If I speak one syllable more, the devil take me! Speak when you
please.</p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> I am going, sir.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> You need not speak twice to me to be silent: Though I take it
somewhat ill of you to be tutored.</p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> This eternal old man will make me mad.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside</i>.</span><br /></p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Why, when do you begin, sir? How long must a man wait for you?
Pray make an end of what you have to say quickly, that I may speak in my
turn too.</p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> This cavalier is in love&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> You told me that before, sir; do you speak oracles, that you
require this strict attention? Either let me share the talk with you, or
I am gone.</p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> Why, sir, I am almost mad to tell you, and you will not suffer
me.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Will you never have done, sir? I must tell you, sir, you have
tattled long enough; and 'tis now good manners to hear me speak. Here's
a torrent of words indeed; a very <i>impetus dicendi</i>; will you never have
done?</p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> I will be heard in spite of you.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>This next speech of</i> <span class="smcap">Lopez</span>, <i>and the next of</i> <span class="smcap">Alonzo's</span>, <i>with both
their replies, are to be spoken at one time, both raising their voices
by little and little, till they bawl, and come up close to shoulder one
another</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Lop.</i> There's one Don Melchor de Guzman, a friend and acquaintance of
mine, that is desperately in love with your eldest daughter Donna
Theodosia.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> [<i>At the same time.</i>] 'Tis the sentence of a philosopher,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
<i>Loquere ut te videam</i>; speak, that I may know thee; now, if you take
away the power of speaking from me&mdash;<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Both pause a little; then speak together again.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> I'll try the language of the law; sure the devil cannot out-talk
that gibberish.&mdash;For this Don Melchor, of Madrid aforesaid, as
premised, I request, move, and supplicate, that you would give, bestow,
marry, and give in marriage, this your daughter aforesaid, to the
cavalier aforesaid.&mdash;Not yet, thou devil of a man! thou shalt be
silent.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Lopez</span> <i>running.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> [<i>At the same time with</i> <span class="smcap">Lopez's</span> <i>last speech, and after</i> <span class="smcap">Lopez</span>
<i>is run out</i>.] Oh, how I hate, abominate, detest, and abhor, these
perpetual talkers, disputants, controverters, and duellers of the
tongue! But, on the other side, if it be not permitted to prudent men to
speak their minds, appositely, and to the purpose, and in few words; if,
I say, the prudent must be tongue-tied, then let great nature be
destroyed; let the order of all things be turned topsy-turvy; let the
goose devour the fox; let the infants preach to their great-grandsires;
let the tender lamb pursue the wolf, and the sick prescribe to the
physician; let fishes live upon dry land, and the beasts of the earth
inhabit in the water; let the fearful hare&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Lopez</span> <i>with a bell, and rings it in his ears.</i></p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Help, help, murder, murder, murder!<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Alonzo</span>, <i>running.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> There was no way but this to be rid of him.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter a Servant.</i></p>

<p><i>Serv.</i> Sir, there are some women without in masquerade, and, I
believe, persons of quality, who are come to play here.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> Bring them in with all respect.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Enter again the Servant, after him</i> <span class="smcap">Jacintha</span>, <span class="smcap">Beatrix</span>, <i>and other
Ladies and Gentlemen: all masqued.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Lop.</i> Cavaliers, and ladies, you are welcome: I wish I had more company
to entertain you:&mdash;Oh, here comes one sooner than I expected.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Wildblood</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Maskall</span>.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> I have swept your gaming house, i'faith; <i>Ecce signum.</i><br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Shows gold.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> Well, here's more to be had of these ladies, if it be your
fortune.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> The first stakes I would play for, should be their veils and
visor masks.</p>

<p><i>Jac. to Beat.</i> Do you think he will not know us?</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> If you keep your design of passing for an African.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Well, now I shall make an absolute trial of him; for, being thus
<i>incognita</i>, I shall discover if he make love to any of you. As for the
gallantry of his serenade, we will not be indebted to him, for we will
make him another with our guitars.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> I'll whisper your intention to the servant, who shall deliver it
to Don Lopez.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<span class="smcap">Beat.</span> <i>whispers to the Serv.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Serv. to Lopez.</i> Sir, the ladies have commanded me to tell you, that
they are willing, before they play, to present you with a dance; and to
give you an essay of their guitars.</p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> They much honour me.</p>

<p class="center">A DANCE.</p>

<p class="center"><i>After the dance, the Cavaliers take the Ladies, and court them.</i> <span
class="smcap">Wildblood</span> <i>takes</i> <span class="smcap">Jacintha.</span></p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> While you have been singing, lady, I have been praying:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
I mean, that your face and wit may not prove equal to your dancing; for,
if they be, there's a heart gone astray, to my knowledge.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> If you pray against me before you have seen me, you'll curse me
when you have looked on me.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> I believe I shall have cause to do so, if your beauty be as
killing as I imagine it.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> 'Tis true, I have been flattered in my own country, with an
opinion of a little handsomeness; but how it will pass in Spain is a
question.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Why, madam, are you not of Spain?</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> No, sir, of Morocco: I only came hither to see some of my
relations, who are settled here, and turned Christians, since the
expulsion of my countrymen, the Moors.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Are you then a Mahometan?</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> A Mussulman, at your service.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> A Mussulwoman, say you? I protest, by your voice, I should have
taken you for a Christian lady of my acquaintance.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> It seems you are in love then: If so, I have done with you. I
dare not invade the dominions of another lady; especially in a country
where my ancestors have been so unfortunate.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Some little liking I might have, but that was only a
morning-dew; 'tis drawn up by the sunshine of your beauty: I find your
African Cupid is a much surer archer than ours of Europe. Yet would I
could see you; one look would secure your victory.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> I'll reserve my face to gratify your imagination with it; make
what head you please, and set it on my shoulders.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Well, madam, an eye, a nose, or a lip shall break no squares:
The face is but a span's breadth of beauty; and where there is so much
besides, I'll never stand with you for that.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> But, in earnest, do you love me?</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Ay, by Alla, do I, most extremely: You have wit in abundance,
you dance to a miracle, you sing like an angel, and, I believe, you look
like a cherubim.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> And can you be constant to me?</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> By Mahomet, can I.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> You swear like a Turk, sir; but, take heed; for our prophet is a
severe punisher of promise breakers.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Your prophet's a cavalier. I honour your prophet and his law,
for providing so well for us lovers in the other world, black eyes, and
fresh maidenheads every day: go thy way, little Mahomet; i'faith, thou
shalt have my good word. But, by his favour, lady, give me leave to tell
you, that we of the uncircumcised, in a civil way, as lovers, have
somewhat the advantage of your mussulman.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> The company are rejoined, and set to play; we must go to them.
Adieu; and when you have a thought to throw away, bestow it on your
servant Fatima.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>She goes to the company.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> This lady Fatima pleases me most infinitely: Now am I got among
the Hamets, the Zegrys, and the Bencerrages. Hey, what work will the
Wildbloods make among the Cids and the Bens of the Arabians?</p>

<p><i>Beat. to Jac.</i> False, or true, madam?</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> False as hell; but, by heaven, I'll fit him for't! Have you the
high-running dice about you?</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> I got them on purpose, madam.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> You shall see me win all their money; and when I have done, I'll
return in my own person, and ask him for the money which he promised
me.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> 'Twill put him upon a strait to be surprised: But, let us to the
table; the company stays for us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span><br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>The company sit.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> What is the ladies' game, sir?</p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> Most commonly they use raffle; that is, to throw with three dice,
till duplets, and a chance be thrown; and the highest duplet wins,
except you throw in and in, which is called raffle; and that wins all.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> I understand it: Come, lady, 'tis no matter what I lose; the
greatest stake, my heart, is gone already.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Jacintha.</span></span><br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>They play; and the rest by couples.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> So, I have a good chance, two quarters and a sice.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Two sixes and a trey wins it.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Sweeps the money.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> No matter; I'll try my fortune once again: What have I here, two
sixes and a quarter?&mdash;An hundred pistoles on that throw.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> I take you, sir.&mdash;Beatrix, the high running dice.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> Here, madam.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Three fives: I have won you, sir.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Ay, the pox take me for't, you have won me: It would never have
vext me to have lost my money to a Christian; but to a pagan, an
infidel&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Pray, sir, leave off while you have some money.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Pox of this lady Fatima! Raffle thrice together! I am out of
patience.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> [<i>To him</i>.] Sir, I beseech you, if you will lose, to lose <i>en
cavalier</i>.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Tol de ra, tol de ra&mdash;pox and curse&mdash;tol de ra. What
the devil did I mean, to play with this brunette of Afric? [<i>The Ladies
rise.</i>] Will you be gone already, ladies?</p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> You have won our money; but, however, we are acknowledging to you
for the honour of your company.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span><br />
<span class="rightalign">[<span class="smcap">Jac.</span> <i>makes a sign of farewell to</i> <span class="smcap">Wild.</span></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Farewell, lady Fatima.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exeunt all but</i> <span class="smcap">Wild.</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mask.</span></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> All the company took notice of your concernment.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> 'Tis no matter; I do not love to fret inwardly, as your silent
losers do, and, in the mean time, be ready to choak for want of vent.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Pray consider your condition a little; a younger brother, in a
foreign country, living at a high rate, your money lost, and without
hope of a supply. Now curse, if you think good.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> No, now I will laugh at myself most unmercifully; for my
condition is so ridiculous, that 'tis past cursing. The pleasantest part
of the adventure is, that I have promised three hundred pistoles to
Jacintha: But there is no remedy, they are now fair Fatima's.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Fatima!</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Ay, ay, a certain African lady of my acquaintance, whom you know
not.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> But who is here, sir?</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Jacintha</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Beatrix</span>, <i>in their own shapes</i>.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Madam, what happy star has conducted you hither to
night!&mdash;A thousand devils of this fortune.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> I was told you had ladies here, and fiddles; so I came partly for
the divertisement, and partly out of jealousy.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Jealousy! Why sure you do not think me a pagan, an infidel? But
the company's broke up, you see. Am I to wait upon you home, or will
you be so kind to take a hard lodging with me to-night?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> You shall have the honour to lead me to my father's.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> No more words, then; let's away, to prevent discovery.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> For my part, I think he has a mind to be rid of you.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> No: But if your lady should want sleep, 'twould spoil the lustre
of her eyes to-morrow. There were a conquest lost.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> I am a peaceable princess, and content with my own; I mean your
heart and purse; for the truth is, I have lost my money to-night in
masquerade, and am come to claim your promise of supplying me.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> You make me happy by commanding me: To-morrow morning my servant
shall wait upon you with three hundred pistoles.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> But I left my company, with promise to return to play.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Play on tick, and lose the Indies, I'll discharge it all
to-morrow.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> To-night, if you'll oblige me.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Maskall, go and bring me three hundred pistoles immediately.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Are you mad, sir?</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Do you expostulate, you rascal! How he stares; I'll be hanged if
he have not lost my gold at play: If you have, confess; you had best,
and perhaps I'll pardon you; but if you do not confess, I'll have no
mercy. Did you lose it?</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Sir, 'tis not for me to dispute with you.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Why, then, let me tell you, you did lose it.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Ay, as sure as e'er he had it, I dare swear for him: But commend
me to you for a kind master, that can let your servant play off three
hundred pistoles, without the least sign of anger to him.<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> 'Tis a sign he has a greater bank in store, to comfort him.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Well, madam, I must confess I have more than I will speak of at
this time; but till you have given me satisfaction&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Satisfaction! why, are you offended, sir?</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Heaven! that you should not perceive it in me: I tell you, I am
mortally offended with you.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Sure, 'tis impossible.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> You have done nothing, I warrant, to make a man jealous: Going
out a gaming in masquerade, at unseasonable hours, and losing your money
at play; that loss, above all, provokes me.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> I believe you; because she comes to you for more.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Is this the quarrel? I'll clear it immediately.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> 'Tis impossible you should clear it: I'll stop my ears, if you
but offer it. There's no satisfaction in the point.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> You'll hear me?&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> To do this in the beginning of an amour, and to a jealous
servant as I am! had I all the wealth of Peru, I would not let go one
maravedis to you.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> To this I answer&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Answer nothing, for it will but inflame the quarrel betwixt us:
I must come to myself by little and little; and when I am ready for
satisfaction, I will take it: But at present it is not for my honour to
be friends.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> Pray let us neighbour princes interpose a little.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> When I have conquered, you may interpose; but at present the
mediation of all Christendom would be fruitless.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Though Christendom can do nothing with you, yet I hope an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
African may prevail. Let me beg you, for the sake of the lady Fatima.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> I begin to suspect, that lady Fatima is no better than she
should be. If she be turned Christian again, I am undone.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> By Alla, I am afraid on't too: By Mahomet, I am.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Well, well, madam, any man may be overtaken with an oath; but I
never meant to perform it with her: You know, no oaths are to be kept
with infidels. But&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> No; the love you made was certainly a design of charity you had
to reconcile the two religions. There's scarce such another man in
Europe, to be sent apostle to convert the Moor ladies.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Faith, I would rather widen their breaches, than make them up.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> I see there's no hope of a reconcilement with you; and therefore
I give it over as desperate.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> You have gained your point, you have my money; and I was only
angry, because I did not know 'twas you, who had it.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> This will not serve your turn, sir: what I have got, I have
conquered from you.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Indeed you use me like one that's conquered; for you have
plundered me of all I had.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> I only disarmed you, for fear you should rebel again; for if you
had the sinews of war, I am sure you would be flying out.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Dare but to stay without a new servant, till I am flush again;
and I will love you, and treat you, and present you at that unreasonable
rate, that I will make you an example to all unbelieving mistresses.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Well, I will try you once more; but you must make haste then,
that we may be within our time; methinks our love is drawn out so
subtle already, that 'tis near breaking.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> I will have more care of it on my part, than the kindred of an
old pope have to preserve him.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Adieu; for this time I wipe off your score, till you are caught
tripping in some new amour.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exeunt Women.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> You have used me very kindly, sir; I thank you.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> You deserved it for not having a lie ready for my occasions. A
good servant should be no more without it, than a soldier without his
arms. But, pr'ythee, advise me what's to be done to get Jacintha.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> You have lost her, or will lose her by your submitting: If we
men could but learn to value ourselves, we should soon take down our
mistresses from all their altitudes, and make them dance after our
pipes, longer perhaps than we had a mind to't. But I must make haste, or
I shall lose Don Melchor.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Call Bellamy, we'll both be present at thy enterprize: Then I'll
once more to the gaming-house with my small stock, for my last refuge:
If I win, I have wherewithal to mollify Jacintha.</p>

<h3>ACT IV. SCENE I.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Bellamy</span>, <span class="smcap">Wildblood</span>, <span class="smcap">Maskall</span>, <i>in a Visor.</i></p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Here comes one, and in all probability it must be Don Melchor,
going to Theodosia.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Stand close, and you shall see me serve the writ upon him.<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Enter Don</i> <span class="smcap">Melchor</span>.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Now, Maskall.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> I stayed here, sir, by express order from the lady Aurelia, to
deliver you this note; and to desire you, from her, to meet her
immediately in the garden.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> Do you hear, friend!</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Not a syllable more, sir; I have performed my orders.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<span class="smcap">Mask.</span> <i>retires to his Masters.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> He's gone, and 'tis in vain for me to look after him. What
envious devil has discovered to Aurelia that I am in town? It must be
Don Lopez, who, to advance his own pretensions to her, has endeavoured
to ruin mine.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> It works rarely.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> But I am resolved to see Aurelia; if it be but to defeat him.
[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Mel</span>.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Let's make haste after him; I long to see the end of this
adventure.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Sir, I think I see some women coming yonder.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Well, I'll leave you to your adventures, while I prosecute my
own.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> I warrant you have made an assignation to instruct some lady in
the mathematics.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> I'll not tell you my design; because, if it does not succeed, you
shall not laugh at me.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exit Bel.</i></span><br /></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Beatrix</span>; <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Jacintha</span>, <i>in the habit of a Mulatto</i>.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Let us withdraw a little, and see if they will come this way.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> We are right, madam; 'tis certainly your Englishman,
and his servant with him. But, why this second trial, when you engaged
to break with him, if he failed in the first?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> 'Tis true, he has been a little inconstant, choleric, or so.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> And it seems you are not contented with those vices, but are
searching him for more. This is the folly of a bleeding gamester, who
will obstinately pursue a losing hand.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> On t'other side, you would have me throw up my cards, before the
game be lost: Let me make this one more trial, when he has money,
whether he will give it me; and then, if he fails&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> You'll forgive him again.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> He's already in purgatory; but the next offence shall put him in
the pit, past all redemption; pr'ythee sing, to draw him nearer: Sure he
cannot know me in this disguise.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> Make haste, then; for I have more irons in the fire: When I have
done with you, I have another assignation of my Lady Theodosia's to Don
Melchor.</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i1"><i>Calm was the even, and clear was the sky,</i></span>
  <span class="i2"><i>And the new-budding flowers did spring,</i></span>
  <span class="i1"><i>When all alone went Amyntas and I,</i></span>
  <span class="i2"><i>To hear the sweet nightingale sing:</i></span>
  <span class="i1"><i>I sate, and he laid him down by me,</i></span>
  <span class="i2"><i>But scarcely his breath he could draw;</i></span>
  <span class="i1"><i>For when, with a fear, he began to draw near,</i></span>
  <span class="i2"><i>He was dashed with, A ha, ha, ha, ha!</i></span>
 <div class="stanza">
 </div>
  <span class="i1"><i>He blushed to himself, and lay still for a while,</i></span>
  <span class="i2"><i>And his modesty curbed his desire;</i></span>
  <span class="i1"><i>But strait I convinced all his fear with a smile,</i></span>
  <span class="i2"><i>Which added new flames to his fire.</i></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
  <span class="i1"><i>O Sylvia, said he, you are cruel,</i></span>
  <span class="i2"><i>To keep your poor lover in awe!</i></span>
  <span class="i1"><i>Then once more he prest with his hand to my breast,</i></span>
  <span class="i2"><i>But was dashed with, A ha, ha, ha, ha!</i></span>
 <div class="stanza">
 </div>
  <span class="i1"><i>I knew 'twas his passion that caused all his fear,</i></span>
  <span class="i2"><i>And therefore I pitied his case;</i></span>
  <span class="i1"><i>I whispered him softly, There's nobody near,</i></span>
  <span class="i2"><i>And laid my cheek close to his face:</i></span>
  <span class="i1"><i>But as he grew bolder and bolder,</i></span>
  <span class="i2"><i>A shepherd came by us and saw;</i></span>
  <span class="i1"><i>And just as our bliss we began with a kiss,</i></span>
  <span class="i2"><i>He laughed out with, A ha, ha, ha, ha!</i></span>
 </div>
</div>

<p><i>Wild.</i> If you dare be the Sylvia, lady, I have brought you a more
confident Amyntas, than that bashful gentleman in your song.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Goes to lay hold of her.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Hold, hold, sir; I am only an ambassadress sent you from a lady:
I hope you will not violate the laws of nations.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> I was only searching for your letters of credence: but methinks,
with that beauty, you look more like a herald that comes to denounce war
to all mankind.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> One of the ladies in the masque to-night has taken a liking to
you; and sent you by me this purse of gold, in recompence of that she
saw you lose.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> And she expects in return of it, that I should wait on her: I'll
do't,&mdash;where lives she? I am desperately in love with her.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Why, can you love her unknown?</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> I have a bank of love, to supply every one's occasions; some for
her, some for another, and some for you; charge what you will upon me,
I pay all at sight, and without questioning who brought the bill.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Hey-day! you dispatch your mistresses as fast, as if you meant to
o'er-run all womankind: Sure you aim at the universal-monarchy.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Now I think on't, I have a foolish fancy to send the lady a
taste of my love by thee.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> 'Tis impossible your love should be so humble, to descend to a
mulatto.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> One would think so, but I cannot help it. Gad, I think the
reason is, because there's something more of sin in thy colour than in
ours. I know not what's the matter, but a turkey-cock is not more
provoked at red, than I bristle at the sight of black. Come, be kinder
to me. Young, and slip an opportunity? 'Tis an evening lost out of your
life.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> These fine things you have said over a thousand times; your cold
compliment's the cold pye of love, which you serve up to every guest
whom you invite.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Come; because thou art very moving, here's part of the gold,
which thou brought'st to corrupt me for thy lady: Truth is, I had
promised a sum to a Spanish lady; but thy eyes have allured it from me.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> You'll repent it to-morrow.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Let to-morrow starve, or provide for himself, as to-night has
done: To-morrow is a cheat in love, and I will not trust it.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Ay, but heaven, that sees all things&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Heaven, that sees all things, will say nothing: That is all
eyes, and no tongue; <i>Et la lune, et les estoiles</i>,&mdash;you know the
song.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> A poor slave, as I am&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> It has been always my humour to love downward. I love to stoop
to my prey, and to have it in my power to souse at, when I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
please. When a man comes to a great lady, he is fain to approach her
with fear and reverence; methinks there's something of godliness in't.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Yet I cannot believe, but the meanness of my habit must needs
scandalize you.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> I tell thee, my friend, and so forth, that I exceedingly honour
coarse linen; 'tis as proper sometimes in an under garment, as a coarse
towel is to rub and scrub me.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Now I am altogether of the other side; I can love no where but
above me: Methinks the rattling of a coach and six sounds more
eloquently than the best harangue a wit could make me.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Do you make no more esteem of a wit then?</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> His commendations serve only to make others have a mind to me; he
does but say grace to me like a chaplain, and, like him, is the last
that shall fall on. He ought to get no more by it, than a poor
silk-weaver does by the ribband which he works, to make a gallant fine.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Then what is a gentleman to hope from you?</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> To be admitted to pass my time with, while a better comes: To be
the lowest step in my staircase, for a knight to mount upon him, and a
lord upon him, and a marquis upon him, and a duke upon him, till I get
as high as I can climb.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> For aught I see, the great ladies have the appetites, which you
slaves should have; and you slaves the pride, which ought to be in
ladies. For, I observe, that all women of your condition are like women
of the play-house, still picking at each other, who shall go the best
dressed, and the richest habits; till you work up one another by your
high flying, as the heron and jerfalcon do. If you cannot out-shine your
fellow with one lover, you fetch her up with another: And, in short,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
all you get by it is only to put finery out of countenance; and to make
the ladies of quality go plain, because they will avoid the scandal of
your bravery.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> [<i>Running in.</i>] Madam, come away; I hear company in the garden.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> You are not going?</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Yes, to cry out a rape, if you follow me.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> However, I am glad you have left your treasure behind you:
Farewell, fairy!</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Farewell, changeling!&mdash;Come, Beatrix.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exeunt Women.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Do you know how you came by this money, sir? You think, I
warrant, that it came by fortune.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> No, sirrah, I know it came by my own industry. Did not I come
out diligently to meet this gold, in the very way it was to come? What
could fate do less for me? They are such thoughtless, and undesigning
rogues as you, that make a drudge of poor Providence, and set it a
shifting for you. Give me a brave fellow like myself, that, if you throw
him down into the world, lights every where upon his legs, and helps
himself without being beholden to fate, that is the hospital of fools.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> But, after all your jollity, what think you if it was Jacintha
that gave it you in this disguise? I am sure I heard her call Beatrix as
she went away.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Umh! thou awaken'st a most villainous apprehension in me!
methought, indeed, I knew the voice: but the face was such an evidence
against it! if it were so, she is lost for ever.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> And so is Beatrix.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Now could I cut my throat for madness.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Now could I break my neck for despair, if I could find a
precipice absolutely to my liking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> 'Tis in vain to consider on't. There's but one way; go you,
Maskall, and find her out, and invent some excuse for me, and be sure to
beg leave I may come and wait upon her with the gold, before she sleeps.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> In the mean time you'll be thinking at your lodging.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> But make haste then to relieve me; for I think over all my
thoughts in half an hour.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Mask.</span></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> [<i>Solus.</i>] Hang it! now I think on't, I shall be but melancholic
at my lodging; I'll go pass my hour at the gaming-house, and make use of
this money while I have tools, to win more to it. Stay, let me
see,&mdash;I have the box and throw. My Don he sets me ten pistoles; I
nick him: Ten more, I sweep them too. Now, in all reason, he is nettled,
and sets me twenty: I win them too. Now he kindles, and butters me with
forty. They are all my own: In fine, he is vehement, and bleeds on to
fourscore or an hundred; and I, not willing to tempt fortune, come away
a moderate winner of two hundred pistoles.</p>

table and lights set on it. The Scene is a Garden with an arbour in it.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The garden-door opens! How now, Aurelia and Camilla in expectation of
Don Melchor at the garden door! I'll away, least I prevent the design,
and within this half hour come sailing back with full pockets, as
wantonly as a laden galleon from the Indies.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exit.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> But dost thou think the Englishman can keep his promise? For, I
confess, I furiously desire to see the idea of Don Melchor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> But, madam, if you should see him, it will not be he, but the
devil in his likeness; and then why should you desire it?</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> In effect 'tis a very dark enigma; and one must be very spiritual
to understand it. But be what it will, body or phantom, I am resolved to
meet it.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Can you do it without fear?</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> No; I must avow it, I am furiously fearful; but yet I am resolved
to sacrifice all things to my love. Therefore, let us pass over that
chapter.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Don</i> <span class="smcap">Melchor,</span> <i>without.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Do you hear, madam, there's one treading already; how if it be
he?</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> If it be he! that is to say his spectre, that is to say his
phantom, that is to say his idea, that is to say, he, and not he.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> [<i>Crying out.</i>] Ah, madam, 'tis he himself; but he's as big again
as he used to be, with eyes like saucers. I'll save myself.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Runs under the table.</i></span><br /></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter Don</i> <span class="smcap">Melchor</span>: <i>They both shriek.</i><br /></p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> Oh heaven! humanity is not able to support it.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Running.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> Dear Aurelia, what mean you?</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> The tempter has imitated his voice too; avoid, avoid, spectre.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> If he should find me under the table now!</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> Is it thus, my dear, that you treat your servant?</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> I am not thy dear; I renounce thee, spirit of darkness!</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> This spirit of darkness is come to see an angel of light by her
command; and to assure her of his constancy, that he will be her's
eternally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> Away, infernal! 'tis not thee; 'tis the true Don Melchor that I
would see.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> Hell and furies!</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> Heaven and angels! Ah&mdash;&mdash;<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Runs out, shrieking.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> This is a riddle past my finding out, to send for me, and then to
shun me; but here's one shall resolve it for me: Camilla, what dost thou
there?</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Help, help! I shall be carried away bodily.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>She rises up, overthrows the table and lights,</i></span><br />
<span class="rightalign"><i>and runs out. The scene shuts.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> [<i>Alone.</i>] Why, Aurelia, Camilla! they are both run out of
hearing! this amazes me; what can the meaning of it be? Sure she has
heard of my unfaithfulness, and was resolved to punish me by this
contrivance! to put an affront upon me by this abrupt departure, as I
did on her by my seeming absence.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Theodosia</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Beatrix.</span><br /></p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> Don Melchor! is it you, my love, that have
frighted Aurelia so terribly?</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> Alas, madam! I know not; but, coming hither by your appointment,
and thinking myself secure in the night without disguise, perhaps it
might work upon her fancy, because she thought me absent.</p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> Since 'tis so unluckily fallen out, that she knows you are at
Madrid, it can no longer be kept a secret; therefore, you must now
pretend openly to me, and run the risk of a denial from my father.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> O, madam, there's no question but he'll refuse me: For, alas!
what is it he can see in me worthy of that honour? Or, if he should be
so partial to me, as some in the world are, to think me valiant,
learned, and not altogether a fool, yet my want of fortune would weigh
down all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> When he has refused you his consent, I may with justice dispose
of myself; and that, while you are constant, shall never be to any but
yourself: In witness of which, accept this diamond, as a pledge of my
heart's firmness to you.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> Madam, your father is coming this way.</p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> 'Tis no matter; do not stir: since he must know you are
returned, let him now see you.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter Don</i> <span class="smcap">Alonzo.</span><br /></p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Daughter, what make you here at this unseasonable hour?</p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> Sir&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> I know what you would say, that you heard a noise, and ran
hither to see what it might be&mdash;&mdash;Bless us! who is this with
you?</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> 'Tis your servant, Don Melchor; just returned from St Sebastians.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> But, sir, I thought you had been upon the sea for Flanders.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> I had so designed it.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> But, why came you back from St Sebastians?</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> As for that, sir, 'tis not material.</p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> An unexpected law-suit has called him back from St Sebastians.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> And how fares my son-in-law, that lives there?</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> In Catholic health, sir.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Have you brought no letters from him?</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> I had, sir, but I was set upon by the way, by picarons: and, in
spite of my resistance, robbed, and my portmanteau taken from me.</p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> And this was that which he was now desiring me to excuse to you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> If my credit, friends, or counsel, can do you any service in
your suit, I hope you will command them freely.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> When I have dispatched some private business, I shall not fail to
trouble you; till then, humbly kisses your hands the most obliged of
your servants.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Melchor.</span></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Daughter, now this cavalier is gone, what occasion brought you
out so late?&mdash;I know what you would say, that it is melancholy; a
tincture of the hypochondria you mean: But, what cause have you for this
melancholy? Give me your hand, and answer me without ambages, or
ambiguities.</p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> He will find out I have given away my ring&mdash;I must prevent
him&mdash;Sir, I am ashamed to confess it to you; but, in hope of your
indulgence, I have lost the table diamond you gave me.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> You would say, The fear of my displeasure has caused the
perturbation in you; well, do not disquiet yourself too much; you say
'tis gone, I say so too. 'Tis stolen; and that by some thief, I take it:
But, I will go and consult the astrologer immediately.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>He is going.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> What have I done? To avoid one inconvenience, I have run into
another: This devil of an astrologer will discover that Don Melchor has
it.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> When did you lose this diamond? The minute and second I should
know; but the hour will serve for the degree ascending.</p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> Sir, the precise time I know not; but it
was betwixt six and seven in the evening, as near
as I can guess.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> 'Tis enough; by all the stars, I'll have it
for you: Therefore, go in, and suppose it on your finger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> I'll watch you at a distance, sir, that my
Englishman may have wherewithal to answer you.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside. Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Theo. Beat</span>.</span><br /></p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> This melancholy, wherewith my daughter laboureth,
is&mdash;a&mdash;I know what I would say, is a certain species of the
hysterical disease; or a certain motion, caused by a certain appetite,
which, at a certain time, heaveth in her, like a certain motion of an
earthquake&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Bellamy.</span><br /></p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> This is the place, and very near the time that Theodosia appoints
her meeting with Don Melchor. He is this night otherwise disposed of
with Aurelia: 'Tis but trying my fortune, to tell her of his infidelity,
and my love. If she yields, she makes me happy; if not, I shall be sure
Don Melchor has not planted the arms of Spain in the fort before me.
However, I'll push my fortune, as sure as I am an Englishman.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Sennor Inglis, I know your voice, though I cannot perfectly
discern you.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> How the devil came he to cross me?</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> I was just coming to have asked another favour of you.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Without ceremony, command me, sir.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> My daughter Theodosia has lost a fair diamond from her finger,
the time betwixt six and seven this evening; now, I desire you, sir, to
erect a scheme for it, and if it be lost, or stolen, to restore it to
me. This is all, sir.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> There is no end of this old fellow; thus will he bait me from day
to day, till my ignorance be found out.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Now is he casting a figure by the art of memory, and making a
judgment of it to himself. This astrology is a very mysterious
speculation.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside.</i></span><br />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> 'Tis a madness for me to hope I can deceive him longer. Since
then he must know I am no astrologer, I'll discover it myself to him,
and blush once for all.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Well, sir, and what do the stars hold forth? What says nimble
master Mercury to the matter?</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Sir, not to keep you longer in ignorance, I must ingenuously
declare to you, that I am not the man for whom you take me. Some
smattering in astrology I have; which my friends, by their indiscretion,
have blown abroad, beyond my intentions. But you are not a person to be
imposed on like the vulgar: Therefore, to satisfy you in one word, my
skill goes not far enough to give you knowledge of what you desire from
me.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> You have said enough, sir, to persuade me of your science; if
fame had not published it, yet this very humility of yours were enough
to confirm me in the belief of it.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Death, you make me mad, sir! Will you have me swear? As I am a
gentleman, a man of the town, one who wears good cloaths, eats, drinks,
and wenches abundantly, I am a damned ignorant, and senseless fellow.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Beatrix</span>.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> How now, gentlewoman?&mdash;What, are you going to relief by
moonshine?</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> I was going on a very charitable office, to help a friend that
was gravelled in a very doubtful business.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Some good news, fortune, I beseech thee.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> But now I have found this learned gentleman, I shall make bold
to propound a question to him from a lady.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> I will have my own question first resolved.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> O, sir, 'tis from a lady.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> If you please, sir, I'll tell it in your ear&mdash;My lady has
given Don Melchor the ring; in whose company her father found her just
now at the garden-door.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>In a whisper.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> [<i>Aloud.</i>] Come to me to-morrow, and you shall receive an answer.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> Your servant, sir.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Beatrix.</span></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Sir, I shall take it very unkindly if you satisfy any other, and
leave me in this perplexity.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Sir, if my knowledge were according&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> No more of that, sir, I beseech you.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Perhaps I may know something by my art concerning it; but, for
your quiet, I wish you would not press me.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Do you think I am not master of my passions?</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Since you will needs know what I would willingly have concealed,
the person, who has your diamond, is he whom you saw last in your
daughter's company.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> You would say 'tis Don Melchor de Guzman. Who the devil would
have suspected him of such an action? But he is of a decayed family, and
poverty, it seems, has enforced him to it. Now I think on't better, he
has e'en stolen it for a fee, to bribe his lawyer; to requite a lie with
a theft. I'll seek him out, and tell him part of my mind before I sleep.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Alon.</span></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> So, once more I am at liberty: But this astrology
is so troublesome a science&mdash;Would I were well rid on't!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter Don</i> <span class="smcap">Lopez,</span> <i>and a Servant.</i></p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> Astrology, does he say? O, cavalier, is it you? not finding you
at home, I came on purpose to seek you out: I have a small request to
the stars by your mediation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Sir, for pity let them shine in quiet a little; for what for
ladies, and their servants, and younger brothers, they scarce get a
holiday in a twelve-month.</p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> Pray, pardon me, if I am a little curious of my destiny, since
all my happiness depends on your answer.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Well, sir, what is it you expect?</p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> To know whether my love to a lady will be successful.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> 'Tis Aurelia, he means. [<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;Sir, in one word I
answer you, that your mistress loves another; one, who is your friend:
But comfort yourself; the dragon's tail is between him and home, he
never shall enjoy her.</p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> But what hope for me?</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> The stars have partly assured me, you shall be happy, if you
acquaint her with your passion, and with the double-dealing of your
friend, who is false to her.</p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> You speak like an oracle. But, I have engaged my promise to that
friend, to serve him in his passion to my mistress.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> We English seldom make such scruples; women are not comprised in
our laws of friendship. They are <i>feræ naturæ</i>; our common game, like
hare and partridge: Every man has equal right to them, as he has to the
sun and elements.</p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> Must I then betray my friend?</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> In that case my friend is a Turk to me, if he will be so
barbarous as to retain two women to his private use. I will be factious
for all distressed damsels; who would much rather have their cause tried
by a full jury, than a single judge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> Well, sir, I will take your counsel; and if I err, the fault be
on love and you.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Lop.</span></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Were it not for love, I would run out of the town, that's the
short on't; for I have engaged myself in so many promises, for the sun
and moon, and those little minced-meats of them, that I must hide before
my day of payment comes. In the mean time I forget Theodosia; but now I
defy the devil to hinder me.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>As he is going out, he meets</i> <span class="smcap">Aurelia</span>, <i>and almost
justles her down. With her</i> <span class="smcap">Camilla</span> <i>enters.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Aur.</i> What rudeness is this?</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Madam Aurelia, is it you?</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> Monsieur Bellamy!</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> The same, madam.</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> My uncle told me he left you here: And, indeed, I came hither to
complain of you. For you have treated me so inhumanly, that I have some
reason to resent it.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> What occasion can I have given you for a complaint?</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> Don Melchor, as I am informed by my uncle, is effectively at
Madrid: So that it was not his idea, but himself in person, whom I saw.
And since you knew this, why did you conceal it from me?</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> When I spoke with you, I knew it not: But I discovered it in the
erecting of my figure. Yet if, instead of his idea, I constrained
himself to come, in spite of his resolution to remain concealed, I think
I have shown a greater effect of my art than what I promised.</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> I render myself to so convincing an argument: But by over-hearing
a discourse just now betwixt my cousin Theodosia and her maid, I find
that he has concealed himself upon her account, which has given me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
jealousy to the last point; for, to avow an incontestible truth, my
cousin is furiously handsome.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Madam, madam, trust not your ears too far; she talked on purpose,
that you might hear her. But, I assure you, the true cause of Don
Melchor's concealment was not love of her, but jealousy of you. He staid
in private to observe your actions: Build upon't, madam, he is
inviolably yours.</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> Then will he sacrifice my cousin to me?</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> 'Tis furiously true, madam.</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> O most agreeable assurance!</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Albricias, madam, for my good news! Don Melchor is coming this
way; I know him by his voice: but he is in company with another person.</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> It will not be convenient to give him any umbrage, by seeing me
with another person; therefore, I will go before; do you stay here, and
conduct him to my apartment. Good-night, sir.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exit.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> I have promised Don Lopez, he shall possess her; and I have
promised her, she shall possess Don Melchor: 'Tis a little difficult, I
confess, as to the matrimonial part of it: But, if Don Melchor will be
civil to her, and she be civil to Don Lopez, my credit is safe without
the benefit of my clergy. But all this is nothing to Theodosia.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Bel.</span></span><br /></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter Don</i> <span class="smcap">Alonzo</span> <i>and Don</i> <span class="smcap">Melchor.</span></p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Don Melchor, a word in private.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> Your pleasure, lady.&mdash;Sir, I will wait on you immediately.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> I am sent to you from a fair lady, who bears you no ill will. You
may guess whom I mean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> Not by my own merits, but by knowing whom you serve. But, I
confess, I wonder at her late strange usage, when she fled from me.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> That was only a mistake; but I have now, by her command, been in
a thousand places in quest of you.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> You overjoy me.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> And where, amongst the rest, do you think I have been looking
you?</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> Pray refresh my memory.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> In that same street, by the same shop&mdash;you know where, by a
good token.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> By what token?</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Just by that shop, where, out of your nobleness, you promised me
a new silk gown.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> O, now I understand you.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Not that I press you to a performance&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> Take this, and please yourself in the choice of it.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Gives her money.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Nay, dear sir, now you make me blush; in faith I&mdash;am
ashamed&mdash;I swear, 'tis only because I would keep something for your
sake;&mdash;but my lady expects you immediately in her apartment.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> I'll wait on her, if I can possibly. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Cam.</span>] But, if I can
prevail with Don Alonzo for his daughter, then will I again consider,
which of the ladies best deserves me. [<i>Aside.</i>] Sir, I beg your pardon
for this rudeness in leaving you.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Alon.</span></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> I cannot possibly resolve with myself to tell him openly he is a
thief; but I'll gild the pill for him to swallow.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> I believe he has discovered our amour: How he surveys me for a
son-in-law!<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Sir, I am sorry for your sake, that true nobility is not always
accompanied with riches to support it in its lustre.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> You have a just exception against the capriciousness of destiny;
yet, if I were owner of any noble qualities, (which I am not) I should
not much esteem the goods of fortune.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> But pray conceive me, sir; your father did not leave you
flourishing in wealth.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> Only a very fair seat in Andalusia, with all the
pleasures imaginable about it: That alone, were my poor deserts
according,&mdash;which, I confess, they are not,&mdash;were enough to
make a woman happy in it.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> But give me leave to come to the point, I beseech you, sir. I
have lost a jewel, which I value infinitely, and I hear it is in your
possession: But I accuse your wants, not you, for it.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> Your daughter is indeed a jewel; but she were not lost, were she
in possession of a man of parts.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> A precious diamond, sir&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> But a man of honour, sir&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> I know what you would say, sir,&mdash;that a man of honour is
not capable of an unworthy action; and, therefore, I do not accuse you
of the theft: I suppose the jewel was only put into your hands.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> By honourable ways, I assure you, sir.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Sir, sir, will you restore my jewel?</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> Will you please, sir, to give me leave to be the unworthy
possessor of her? I know how to use her with that respect&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> I know what you would say, sir; but if it belong to our family?
otherwise, I assure you, it were at your service.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> As it belongs to your family, I covet it; not that I plead my own
deserts, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Sir, I know your deserts; but, I protest, I cannot part with it:
For, I must tell you, this diamond ring was originally my
great-grandfather's.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> A diamond ring, sir, do you mean?&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> By your patience, sir; when I have done, you may speak your
pleasure. I only lent it to my daughter; but, how she lost it, and how
it came upon your finger, I am yet <i>in tenebris.</i></p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> Sir&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> I know it, sir; but spare yourself the trouble, I'll speak for
you; you would say you had it from some other hand; I believe it, sir.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> But, sir&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> I warrant you, sir, I'll bring you off without your
speaking;&mdash;from another hand you had it; and now, sir, as you say,
sir, and as I am saying for you, sir, you are loth to part with it.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> Good sir,&mdash;&mdash;let me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> I understand you already, sir,&mdash;that you have taken a fancy
to it, and would buy it; but, to that I answer, as I did before, that it
is a relick of my family: Now, sir, if you can urge aught farther, you
have liberty to speak without interruption.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> This diamond you speak of, I confess&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> But what need you confess, sir, before you are accused?</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> You promised you would hear me in my turn, sir, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> But, as you were saying, it is needless, because I have already
spoken for you.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> The truth is, sir, I was too presumptuous to take this pledge
from Theodosia without your knowledge; but you will pardon the
invincible necessity, when I tell you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> You need not tell me; I know your necessity was the reason of
it, and that place and opportunity have caused your error.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> This is the goodest old man I ever knew; he prevents me in my
motion for his daughter. [<i>Aside.</i> Since, sir, you know the cause of my
errors, and are pleased to lay part of the blame upon youth and
opportunity, I beseech you, favour me so far to accept me, as fair
Theodosia already has&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> I conceive you, sir,&mdash;that I would accept of your excuse:
Why, restore the diamond, and 'tis done.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> More joyfully than I received it: And, with it, I beg the honour
to be received by you as your son-in-law.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> My son-in-law! this is the most pleasant proposition I ever
heard.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> I am proud you think it so; but, I protest, I think not I deserve
this honour.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Nor I, I assure you, sir; marry my daughter&mdash;ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> But, sir&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> I know what you would say, sir&mdash;that there is too much
hazard in the profession of a thief, and therefore you would marry my
daughter to become rich, without venturing your neck for't. I beseech
you, sir, steal on, be apprehended, and, if you please, be hanged, it
shall make no breach betwixt us. For my part, I'll keep your counsel,
and so, good night, sir.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Alon.</span></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> Is the devil in this old man, first to give me occasion to
confess my love, and, when he knew it, to promise he would keep my
counsel? But who are these? I'll not be seen; but to my old appointment
with Theodosia, and desire her to unriddle it.<br />

<p><i>Mask.</i> But, madam, do you take me for a man of honour?</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> No.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Why there's it! if you had, I would have sworn that my master
has neither done nor intended you any injury. I suppose you'll grant he
knew you in your disguise?</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> Nay, to know her, and use her so, is an aggravation of his
crime.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Unconscionable Beatrix! would you two have all the carnival to
yourselves? He knew you, madam, and was resolved to countermine you in
all your plots. But, when he saw you so much piqued, he was too good
natured to let you sleep in wrath, and sent me to you to disabuse you:
for, if the business had gone on till to-morrow, when Lent begins, you
would have grown so peevish (as all good Catholics are with fasting)
that the quarrel would never have been ended.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Well; this mollifies a little: I am content he shall see me.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> But that you may be sure he knew you, he will bring the
certificate of the purse along with him.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> I shall be glad to find him innocent.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> No mortal man ever threw out so often. It could not be me, it

after I had thrown them. But, I'll be even with him; for, I'll never
throw one of his dice more.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Madam, 'tis certainly my master; and he is so zealous to
make his peace, that he could not stay till I called him to
you.&mdash;&mdash;Sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Sirrah, I'll teach you more manners than to leave me another
time: You rogue, you have lost me two hundred pistoles, you and the
devil your accomplice; you, by leaving me to myself, and he, by tempting
me to play it off.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Is the wind in that door? Here's like to be fine doings.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> O mischief! am I fallen into her ambush? I must face it out with
another quarrel.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Your man has been treating your accommodation; 'tis half made
already.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Ay, on your part it may be.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> He says you knew me.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Yes; I do know you so well, that my poor heart aches for't. I
was going to bed without telling you my mind; but, upon consideration, I
am come&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> To bring the money with you.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> To declare my grievances, which are great and many.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Well, for impudence, let thee alone.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> As, in the first place&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> I'll hear no grievances; where's the money?</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> Ay, keep to that, madam.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Do you think me a person to be so used?</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> We will not quarrel; where's the money?</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> By your favour we will quarrel.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> Money, money!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> I am angry, and can hear nothing.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> Money, money, money, money!</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Do you think it a reasonable thing to put on two disguises in a
night, to tempt a man? (Help me, Maskall, for I want arguments
abominably.) I thank heaven I was never so barbarously used in all my
life.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> He begins to anger me in good earnest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> A thing so much against the rules of modesty! So indecent a
thing!</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Ay so indecent a thing: Nay, now I do not wonder at myself for
being angry. And then to wonder I should love her in those disguises! To
quarrel at the natural desires of human kind, assaulted by powerful
temptations; I am enraged at that.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Heyday! you had best quarrel too for my bringing you the money.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> I have a grudging to you for't: (Maskall, the money, Maskall!
now help, or we are gone.)</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Would she offer to bring money to you? first, to affront your
poverty&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Ay, to affront my poverty: But that's no great matter; and
then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> And then to bring you money, sir. (I stick fast, sir.)</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> (Forward, you dog, and invent, or I'll cut your throat.) And
then, as I was saying, to bring me money&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Which is the greatest and most sweet of all temptations; and to
think you could resist it: Being also aggravated by her handsomeness,
who brought it.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Resist it? No; I would she would understand it; I know better
what belongs to flesh and blood than so.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> to <i>Jac.</i> This is plain confederacy: I smoke it; he came on
purpose to quarrel with you; break first with him, and prevent it.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> If it be come to that once, the devil take the hindmost! I'll not
be last in love, for that will be a dishonour to my sex.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> And then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Hold, sir, there needs no more; you shall fall out, and I'll
gratify you with a new occasion: I only tried you in hope you would be
false; and, rather than fail of my design, brought gold to bribe you
to't.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> As people, when they have an ill bargain, are content to lose by
it, that they may get it off their hands.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Beatrix, while our principals are engaged, I hold it not for our
honour to stand idle.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> With all my heart: Please you let us draw off to some other
ground.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> I dare meet you on any spot, but one.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> I think we shall do well to put it to an issue: this is the last
time you shall ever be troubled with my addresses.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> The favour had been greater to have spared this too.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Beatrix, let us dispatch; or they'll break off before us.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> Break as fast as thou wilt; I am as brittle as thou art, for thy
heart.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Because I will absolutely break off with you, I will keep
nothing that belongs to you; therefore take back your picture, and your
handkerchief.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> I have nothing of yours to keep; therefore take back your liberal
promises. Take them in imagination.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Not to be behindhand with you in your frumps, I give you back
your purse of gold: Take you that&mdash;in imagination.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> To conclude with you, take back your oaths and protestations;
they are never the worse for the wearing, I assure you: Therefore take
them, spick and span new, for the use of your next mistress.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Beatrix, follow your leader; here's the six-penny whittle you
gave me, with the mutton haft: I can spare it, for knives are of little
use in Spain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> There's your scissars with the stinking brass chain to them:
'Tis well there was no love betwixt us; for they had been too dull to
cut it.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> There's the dandriff comb you lent me.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> There's your ferret-ribbanding for garters.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> I would never have come so near as to have taken them from you.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> For your letter, I have it not about me; but upon reputation
I'll burn it.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> And for yours, I have already put it to a fitting
employment.&mdash;Courage, sir; how goes the battle on your wing?</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Just drawing off on both sides. Adieu, Spain.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Farewell, old England.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> Come away in triumph; the day's your own, madam.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> I'll bear you off upon my shoulders, sir; we have broke their
hearts.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Let her go first then; I'll stay, and keep the honour of the
field.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> I'll not retreat, if you stay till midnight.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Are you sure then we have done loving?</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Yes, very sure; I think so.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> 'Tis well you are so; for otherwise I feel my stomach a little
maukish. I should have doubted another fit of love were coming up.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> No, no; your inconstancy secures you enough for that.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> That's it which makes me fear my own returning: Nothing vexes
me, but that you should part with me so slightly, as though I were not
worth your keeping. Well, 'tis a sign you never loved me.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> 'Tis the least of your care whether I did or did not: It may be
it had been more for the quiet of myself, if I&mdash;but 'tis no
matter, I'll not give you that satisfaction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> But what's the reason you will not give it me?</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> For the reason that we are quite broke off.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Why, are we quite, quite broke off?</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Why, are we not?</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Well, since 'tis past, 'tis past; but a pox of all foolish
quarrelling, for my part.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> And a mischief of all foolish disguisements, for my part.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> But if it were to do again with another mistress, I would even
plainly confess I had lost my money.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> And if I had to deal with another servant, I would learn more wit
than to tempt him in disguises: for that's to throw a Venice-glass to
the ground, to try if it would not break.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> If it were not to please you, I see no necessity of our parting.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> I protest, I do it only out of complaisance to you.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> But if I should play the fool, and ask your pardon, you would
refuse it.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> No, never submit; for I should spoil you again with pardoning
you.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Do you hear this, Beatrix! They are just upon the point of
accommodation; we must make haste, or they'll make a peace by
themselves, and exclude us from the treaty.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> Declare yourself the aggressor then, and I'll take you into
mercy.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> The worst that you can say of me is, that I have loved you
thrice over.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> The prime articles between Spain and England are sealed; for the
rest, concerning a more strict alliance, if you please, we'll dispute
them in the garden.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> But, in the first place, let us agree on the article of
navigation, I beseech you.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> These leagues, offensive and defensive, will be too strict for
us, Maskall: A treaty of commerce will serve our turn.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> With all my heart; and when our loves are veering, We'll make no
words, but fall to privateering.<br />

<h3>ACT V. SCENE I.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Lopez</span>, <span class="smcap">Aurelia</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Camilla.</span></p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> 'Tis true, if he had continued constant to you, I should have
thought myself obliged in honour to be his friend; but I could no longer
suffer him to abuse a person of your worth and beauty, with a feigned
affection.</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> But is it possible Don Melchor should be false to love? I'll be
sworn I did not imagine such a treachery could have been in nature;
especially to a lady who had so obliged him.</p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> 'Twas this, madam, which gave me the confidence to wait upon you
at an hour, which would be otherwise unseasonable.</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> You are the most obliging person in the world.</p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> But to clear it to you that he is false, he is, at this very
minute, at an assignation with your cousin in the garden; I am sure he
was endeavouring it not an hour ago.</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> I swear this evening's air begins to incommode me extremely with
a cold: but yet, in hope of detecting this perjured man, I am content
to stay abroad.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> But withal, you must permit me to tell you, madam, that it is but
just I should have some share in a heart, which I endeavour to redeem:
In the law of arms, you know that they, who pay the ransom, have right
to dispose of the prisoner.</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> The prize is so very inconsiderable, that 'tis not worth the
claiming.</p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> If I thought the boon were small, I would not importune my
princess with the asking it: But since my life depends upon the
grant&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Ma'am, I must needs tell your la'ship, that Don Lopez has
deserved you, for he has acted all along like a cavalier, and more for
your interest than his own. Besides, ma'am, Don Melchor is as poor as he
is false: For my part, I shall never endure to call him master.</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> Don Lopez, go along with me. I can promise nothing, but I swear I
will do my best to disengage my heart from this furious tender, which I
have for him.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> If I had been a man, I could never have forsaken you: Ah those
languishing casts, ma'am; and that pouting lip of your la'ship, like a
cherry-bough, weighed down with the weight of fruit!</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> And that sigh too, I think, is not altogether disagreeable; but
something <i>charmante</i> and <i>mignonne</i>.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Well, Don Lopez, you'll be but too happy.</p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> If I were once possessor&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Bellamy</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Theodosia.</span></p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> O we are surprised.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Fear nothing, madam; I think, I know them: Don Lopez?</p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> Our famous astrologer, how come you here?</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> I am infinitely happy to have met you with Donna Aurelia, that
you may do me the favour to satisfy this lady of a truth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
which I can scarce persuade her to believe.</p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> I am glad our concernments are so equal; for I have the like
favour to ask from Donna Theodosia.</p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> Don Lopez is too noble to be refused any thing within my power;
and I am ready to do him any service, after I have asked my cousin, if
ever Don Melchor pretended to her?</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> 'Tis the very question which I was furiously resolved to have
asked of you.</p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> I must confess he has made some professions to me: And withal, I
will acknowledge my own weakness so far as to tell you, I have given way
he should often visit me, when the world believed him absent.</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> O cavalier astrologer, how have you betrayed me! did you not
assure me, that Don Melchor's tender and inclination was for me only?</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> I had it from his star, madam, I do assure you; and if that
twinkled false, I cannot help it. The truth is, there's no trusting the
planet of an inconstant man; he was moving to you when I looked on it,
and if since it has changed the course, I am not to be blamed for it.</p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> Now, madam, the truth is evident. And for this cavalier, he might
easily be deceived in Melchor; for I dare affirm it to you both, he
never knew to which of you he was most inclined: For he visited one, and
writ letters to the other.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> to <i>Theo.</i> Then, madam, I must claim your promise, (since I have
discovered to you that Don Melchor is unworthy of your favours) that you
would make me happy, who, amongst my many imperfections, can never be
guilty of such a falsehood.</p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> If I have been deceived in Melchor, whom I have known so long,
you cannot reasonably expect, I should trust you at a day's
acquaintance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> For that, madam, you may know as much of me in a day, as you can
in all your life: All my humours circulate like my blood, at farthest
within twenty-four hours. I am plain and true, like all my countrymen;
you see to the bottom of me as easily, as you do to the gravel of a
clear stream in autumn.</p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> You plead so well, sir, that I desire you would speak for me too:
My cause is the same with yours, only it has not so good an advocate.</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> Since I cannot make myself happy, I will have the glory to
felicitate another: and, therefore, I declare, I will reward the
fidelity of Don Lopez.</p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> All that I can say at present is, that I will never be Don
Melchor's: The rest, time and your service must make out.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> I have all I can expect, to be admitted as eldest servant; as
preferment falls, I hope you will remember my seniority.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Ma'am, Don Melchor.</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> Cavaliers, retire a little; we shall see to which of us he will
make his court.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>The men withdraw.</i></span><br /></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Don Melchor.</span></p>

<p>Don Melchor, I thought you had been a-bed before
this time.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> Fair Aurelia, this is a blessing beyond expectation,
to see you again so soon.</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> What important business brought you hither?</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> Only to make my peace with you before I slept. You know you are
the saint to whom I pay my devotions.</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> And yet it was beyond your expectances to meet me? This is
furiously incongruous.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> [<i>advancing.</i>] Don Melchor, whither were you bound so late?</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> What shall I say? I am so confounded, that I know not to which of
them I should excuse myself.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> Pray answer me truly to one question: Did you ever make any
addresses to my cousin?</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> Fie, fie, madam, there's a question indeed.</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> How, monster of ingratitude! can you deny the declaration of your
passion to me?</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> I say nothing, madam.</p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> Which of us is it, for whom you are concerned?</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> For that, madam, you must excuse me; I have more discretion than
to boast a lady's favour.</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> Did you counterfeit an address to me?</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> Still I say nothing, madam; but I will satisfy either of you in
private; for these matters are too tender for public discourse.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Lopez</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Bellamy</span> <i>hastily, with their swords drawn.</i></p>

<p>Bellamy and Lopez! This is strange!</p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> Ladies, we would not have disturbed you, but as we were walking
to the garden door, it opened suddenly against us, and we confusedly
saw, by moonlight, some persons entering, but who they were we know not.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> You had best retire into the garden-house, and leave us to take
our fortunes, without prejudice to your reputations.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Wildblood, Maskall, Jacintha</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Beatrix</span>.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> [<i>To Jacintha entering.</i>] Do not fear, madam, I think I heard my
friend's voice.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Marry hang you, is it you that have given us this hot alarm?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> There's more in it than you imagine; the whole house is up: For
seeing you two, and not knowing you, after I had entered the
garden-door, I made too much haste to get out again, and have left the
key broken in it. With the noise, one of the servants came running in,
whom I forced back; and, doubtless, he is gone for company, for you may
see lights running through every chamber.</p>

<p><i>Theo. Jac.</i> What will become of us?</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> We must have recourse to our former resolution. Let the ladies
retire into the garden-house. And, now I think on it, you gentlemen
shall go in with them, and leave me and Maskall to bear the brunt of it.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Me, sir! I beseech you let me go in with the ladies too; dear
Beatrix, speak a good word for me! I protest 'tis more out of love to
thy company than for any fear I have.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> You dog, I have need of your wit and counsel. We have no time to
deliberate. Will you stay, sir?<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Maskall.</span></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> No, sir, 'tis not for my safety.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Will you in, sir?<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Melchor.</span></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> No, sir, 'tis not for my honour, to be assisting to you: I'll to
Don Alonzo, and help to revenge the injury you are doing him.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Then we are lost, I can do nothing.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Nay, an you talk of honour, by your leave, sir. I hate your
Spanish honour, ever since it spoiled our English plays, with faces
about and t'other side.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Falls upon him and throws him down.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> What do you mean, you will not murder me? Must valour be
oppressed by multitudes?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Come yarely, my mates, every man to his share of the burden.
Come, yarely, hay.</p>

<p class="center">[<i>The four men take him each by a limb, and carry him out, he crying
murder.</i></p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> If this Englishman save us now, I shall admire his wit.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> Good wits never think themselves admired till they are well
rewarded: You must pay him in specie, madam; give him love for his wit.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter the Men again.</i><br /></p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Ladies, fear nothing, but enter into the garden-house with these
cavaliers.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> O that I were a cavalier too!<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Is going with them.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Come you back, sirrah. [<i>Stops him.</i>] Think yourselves as safe as
in a sanctuary; only keep quiet, whatever happens.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Come away then, they are upon us.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exeunt all but</i> <span class="smcap">Bel.</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mask</span>.</span><br /></p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Hark, I hear the foe coming: Methinks they threaten too, sir;
pray let me go in for a guard to the ladies and poor Beatrix. I can
fight much better, when there is a wall betwixt me and danger.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Peace, I have occasion for your wit to help me to lie.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Sir, upon the faith of a sinner, you have had my last lie
already; I have not one more to do me credit, as I hope to be saved,
sir.</p>

<p>Bel. <i>Victoire, victoire!</i> knock under, you rogue, and confess me
conqueror, and you shall see I'll bring all off.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Don Alonzo</span>, <i>and six Servants; with lights,
and swords drawn</i>.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Search about there.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Fear nothing, do but vouch what I shall say.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> For a passive lie I can yet do something.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Stand: who goes there?</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Friends.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Friends! Who are you?</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Noble Don Alonzo, such as are watching for your good.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Is it you, Sennor Inglis? Why all this noise and tumult? Where
are my daughters and my niece? But, in the first place, though last
named, how came you hither, sir?</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> I came hither&mdash;by astrology, sir.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> My master's in; heavens send him good shipping with his lie, and
all kind devils stand his friends!</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> How! by astrology, sir? Meaning, you came hither by art magic.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> I say by pure astrology, sir; I foresaw by my art, a little after
I had left you, that your niece and daughters would this night run a
risque of being carried away from this very garden.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> O the wonders of this speculation!</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Thereupon I called immediately for my sword, and came in all
haste to advertise you; but I see there's no resisting destiny; for just
as I was entering the garden door, I met the women with their gallants
all under sail, and outward bound.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Thereupon what does me he, but draws, by my advice&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> How now, Mr Rascal? Are you itching to be in?<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Pray, sir, let me go snip with you in this lie, and be not too
covetous of honour. You know I never stood with you; now my courage is
come to me, I cannot resist the temptation.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Content; tell on.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> So, in short, sir, we drew, first I, and then my master; but,
being overpowered, they have escaped us, so that I think you may go to
bed, and trouble yourself no further, for gone they are.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> You tell a lie! you have curtailed my invention: You are not fit
to invent a lie for a bawd, when she would wheedle a young squire.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Aside.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Call up the officers of justice, I'll have the town searched
immediately.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> 'Tis in vain, sir; I know, by my art, you'll never recover them:
Besides, 'tis an affront to my friends, the stars, who have otherwise
disposed of them.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter a Servant.</i><br /> </p>

<p><i>Ser.</i> Sir, the key is broken in the garden-door, and the door locked,
so that of necessity they must be in the garden yet.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Disperse yourselves, some into the wilderness, some into the
alleys, and some into the parterre: You, Diego, go try to get out the
key, and run to the corrigidor for his assistance: In the mean time,
I'll search the garden-house myself.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exeunt all the servants but one.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> I'll be unbetted again, if you please, sir, and leave you all
the honour of it.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Bellamy</span> <i>aside.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Come, cavalier, let us in together.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> [<i>holding him.</i>] Hold, sir, for the love of heaven! you are not
mad?</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> We must leave no place unsearched. A light there.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Hold, I say! do you know what you are undertaking? And have you
armed yourself with resolution for such an adventure?</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> What adventure?</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> A word in private&mdash;The place you would go into is full of
enchantments; there are at this time, for aught I know, a legion of
spirits in it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> You confound me with wonder, sir!</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> I have been making there my magical operations, to know the event
of your daughters' flight; and, to perform it rightly, have been forced
to call up spirits of several orders: And there they are humming like a
swarm of bees, some stalking about upon the ground, some flying, and
some sticking upon the walls like rear-mice.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> The devil's in him, he's got off again.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Now, sir, I shall try the truth of your friendship to me. To
confess the secret of my soul to you, I have all my life been curious to
see a devil; and to that purpose have conned Agrippa through and
through, and made experiment of all his rules, <i>Pari die et incremento
Lunæ</i>, and yet could never compass the sight of one of these
<i>dæmoniums</i>: If you will ever oblige me, let it be on this occasion.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> There's another storm arising.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> You shall pardon me, sir; I'll not expose you to that peril for
the world, without due preparations of ceremony.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> For that, sir, I always carry a talisman about me, that will
secure me: And therefore I will venture in, a God's name, and defy them
all at once.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Going in.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> How the pox will he get off from this?</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Well, sir, since you are so resolved, send off your servant, that
there may be no noise made on't, and we'll take our venture.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Pedro, leave your light, and help the fellows to search the
garden.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Exit Servant.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> What does my incomprehensible master mean?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Now, I must tell you, sir, you will see that, which will very
much astonish you, if my art fail me not. [<i>Goes to the door.</i>] You
spirits and intelligences, that are within there, stand close, and
silent, at your peril, and fear nothing, but appear in your own shapes,
boldly.&mdash;Maskall, open the door.</p>

<p>Now, sir, what think you?</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> They are here, they are here: We need search no farther. Ah you
ungracious baggages!<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Going toward them.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Stay, or you'll be torn in pieces: These are the very shapes I
conjured up, and truly represent to you in what company your niece and
daughters are, this very moment.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Why, are they not they? I durst have sworn that some of them had
been my own flesh and blood.&mdash;Look; one of them is just like that
rogue, your comrade.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<span class="smcap">Wild.</span> <i>shakes his head, and frowns at him</i>.</span><br /></p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Do you see how you have provoked that English devil? Take heed of
him; if he gets you once into his clutches&mdash;<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<span class="smcap">Wild.</span> <i>embracing</i> <span class="smcap">Jac.</span></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> He seems to have got possession of the spirit of my Jacintha, by
his hugging her.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Nay, I imagined as much: Do but look upon his
physiognomy&mdash;you have read Baptista Porta? Has he not the leer of a
very lewd, debauched spirit?</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> He has indeed: Then there's my niece Aurelia, with the spirit of
Don Lopez; but that's well enough; and my daughter Theodosia all alone:
Pray how comes that about?</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> She's provided for with a familiar too: One that is in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
this very room with you, and by your elbow; but I'll shew you him some
other time.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> And that baggage Beatrix, how I would swinge her, if I had her
here: I'll lay my life she was in the plot for the flight of her
mistresses.<br />
<span class="rightalign"><span style="margin-left: 3em;">[<span class="smcap">Beat.</span> <i>claps her hands at him.</i></span></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Sir, you do ill to provoke her; for being the spirit of a woman,
she is naturally mischievous: You see she can scarce hold her hands from
you already.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Let me alone to revenge your quarrel upon Beatrix: If e'er she
come to light, I'll take a course with her, I warrant you, sir.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Now come away, sir, you have seen enough; the spirits are in pain
whilst we are here: We keep them too long condensed in bodies; if we
were gone, they would rarify into air immediately.&mdash;Maskall, shut
the door.<br />

<p class="center"><i>Enter two Servants with Don</i> <span class="smcap">Melchor</span>.<br /></p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Now help me with a lie, Maskall, or we are lost.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Sir, I could never lie with man or woman in a fright.</p>

<p><i>Serv.</i> Sir, we found this gentleman bound and gagged, and he desired us
to bring him to you with all haste imaginable.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> O, sir, sir! your two daughters and your niece&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> They are gone; he knows it:&mdash;But are you mad, sir, to set
this pernicious wretch at liberty?</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> I endeavoured all that I was able&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> Now, sir, I have it for you. [<i>Aside to his master.</i>]&mdash;He
was endeavouring, indeed, to have got away with them; for your daughter
Theodosia was his prize. But we prevented him, and left him in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
condition in which you see him.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> I thought somewhat was the matter, that Theodosia had not a
spirit by her, as her sister had.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> This was he I meant to shew you.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> Do you believe him, sir?</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> No, no, believe him, sir: You know his truth, ever since he stole
your daughter's diamond.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> I swear to you, by my honour&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Nay, a thief I knew him; and yet, after that, he had the
impudence to ask me for my daughter.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Was he so impudent? The case is plain, sir; put him quickly into
custody.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> Hear me but one word, sir, and I'll discover all to you.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Hear him not, sir; for my art assures me, if he speaks one
syllable more, he will cause great mischief.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Will he so? I'll stop my ears; away with him.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> Your daughters are yet in the garden, hidden by this fellow and
his accomplices.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> [<i>At the same time, drowning him.</i>] I'll stop my ears, I'll stop
my ears.</p>

<p><i>Bel. Mask.</i> [<i>At the same time also.</i>] A thief, a thief! away with
him.<br />

<p><i>Serv.</i> Sir, with much ado we have got out the key, and opened the door.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Then, as I told you, run quickly to the corrigidor, and desire
him to come hither in person to examine a malefactor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
[<span class="smcap">Wildblood</span> <i>sneezes within</i>.] Hark! what noise is that within? I think

<p><i>Bel.</i> One of the devils, I warrant you, has got a

<p><i>Alon.</i> Bless his devilship, as I may say.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<span class="smcap">Wildblood</span> <i>sneezes again.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Serv.</i> [<i>To Don</i> <span class="smcap">Alonzo</span>.] This is a man's voice;
do not suffer yourself to be deceived so grossly, sir.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> A man's voice! that's a good one indeed, that you should live to
these years, and yet be so silly as not to know a man from a devil.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> There's more in't than I imagined: Hold up your torch, and go in
first, Pedro, and I'll follow you.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> No, let me have the honour to be your usher.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Takes the torch and goes in.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> [<i>Within.</i>] Help, help, help!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Maskall</span> <i>again, without the torch</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> I was no sooner entered, but a huge giant seized my torch, and
felled me along, with the very whiff of his breath, as he passed by me.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Bless us!</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> [<i>At the door to them within.</i>] Pass out now, while you have
time, in the dark: The officers of justice will be here immediately; the
garden-door is open for you.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> What are you muttering there, sir?</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Only dismissing these spirits of darkness, that they may trouble
you no further.&mdash;Go out, I say.</p>

<p class="center">[<i>They all come out upon the stage, groping their way.</i> <span class="smcap">Wildblood</span> <i>falls

<p><i>Alon.</i> [<i>Letting</i> <span class="smcap">Wild.</span> <i>go</i>.] Is it thee, Maskall? I durst have sworn

<p class="center"><i>Enter Servants with lights, and swords drawn.</i><br /> </p>

<p><i>Serv.</i> Sir, the corrigidor is coming, according to your desire: In the
mean time, we have secured the garden doors.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> I'm glad on't: I'll make some of them severe examples.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Nay, then, as we have lived merrily, so let us die together: But
we'll shew the Don some sport first.</p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> What will become of us!</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> We'll die for company: Nothing vexes me, but that I am not a man,
to have one thrust at that malicious old father of mine before I go.</p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> Let us break our way through the corrigidor's band.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> A match, i'faith. We'll venture our bodies with you: You shall
put the baggage in the middle.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> He that pierces thee, I say no more, but I shall be somewhat
angry with him.&mdash;[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Alon</span>.] In the mean time, I arrest you, sir,
in the behalf of this good company. As the corrigidor uses us, so we'll
use you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> You do not mean to murder me!</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> You murder yourself, if you force us to it.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Give me a razor there, that I may scrape his weeson, that the
bristles may not hinder me, when I come to cut it.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> What need you bring matters to that extremity? You have your
ransom in your hand: Here are three men, and there are three women; you
understand me.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> If not, here's a sword, and there's a throat; you understand me.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> This is very hard!</p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> The propositions are good, and marriage is as honourable as it
used to be.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> You had best let your daughters live branded with the name of
strumpets; for whatever befals the men, that will be sure to be their
share.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> I can put them into a nunnery.</p>

<p><i>All the Women.</i> A nunnery!</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> I would have thee to know, thou graceless old man, that I defy a
nunnery: Name a nunnery once more, and I disown thee for my father.</p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> You know the custom of the country, in this case, sir: 'Tis
either death or marriage. The business will certainly be public; and if
they die, they have sworn you shall bear them company.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Since it must be so, run, Pedro, and stop the corrigidor: Tell
him it was only a carnival merriment, which I mistook for a rape and
robbery.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Why now you are a dutiful father again, and I receive you into
grace.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Among the rest of your mistakes, sir, I must desire you to let my
astrology pass for one: My mathematics, and art magic, were only a
carnival device; and now that's ending, I have more mind to deal with
the flesh, than with the devil.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> No astrologer! 'tis impossible!</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> I have known him, sir, these seven years, and dare take my oath,
he has been always an utter stranger to the stars; and indeed to any
thing that belongs to heaven.</p>

<p><i>Lop.</i> Then I have been cozened among the rest.</p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> And I; but I forgive him.</p>

<p><i>Beat.</i> I hope you will forgive me, madam, who have been the cause on't;
but what he wants in astrology, he shall make up to you some other way,
I'll pass my word for him.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> I hope you are both gentlemen?</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> As good as the cid himself, sir.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> And for your religion, right Romans&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> As ever was Mark Anthony.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> For your fortunes and courages&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> They are both desperate, sir; especially their fortunes.</p>

<p><i>Theo.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Bel</span>.] You should not have had my consent so soon, but only
to revenge myself upon the falseness of Don Melchor.</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> I must avow, that gratitude for Don Lopez is as prevalent with
me, as revenge against Don Melchor.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Lent, you know, begins to-morrow; when that's over, marriage
will be proper.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> If I stay till after Lent, I shall be to marry when I have no
love left: I'll not bate you an ace of to-night, father; I mean to bury
this man ere Lent be done, and get me another before Easter.</p>

<p><i>Alon.</i> Well, make a night on't then.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Giving his daughters.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Jacintha Wildblood, welcome to me: Since our stars have doomed
it so, we cannot help it; but 'twas a mere trick of fate, to catch us
thus at unawares; to draw us in, with a what do you lack, as we passed
by: Had we once separated to-night, we should have had more wit, than
ever to have met again to-morrow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> 'Tis true, we shot each other flying: We were both upon the wing,
I find; and, had we passed this critical minute, I should have gone for
the Indies, and you for Greenland, ere we had met in a bed, upon
consideration.</p>

<p><i>Mask.</i> You have quarrelled twice to-night without bloodshed; beware the
third time.</p>

<p>Jac. <i>Apropos!</i> I have been retrieving an old song of a lover, that
was ever quarrelling with his mistress: I think it will fit our amour so
well, that, if you please, I'll give it you for an epithalamium; and you
shall sing it.<br />
<span class="rightalign">[<i>Gives him a paper.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> I never sung in all my life; nor ever durst try, when I was
alone, for fear of braying.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Just me, up and down; but for a frolic, let's sing together; for
I am sure, if we cannot sing now, we shall never have cause when we are
married.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Begin then; give me my key, and I'll set my voice to't.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Fa la, fa la, fa la.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Fala, fala, fala. Is this your best, upon the faith of a virgin?</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Ay, by the muses, I am at my pitch.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Then do your worst; and let the company be judge who sings
worst.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Upon condition the best singer shall wear the breeches. Prepare
to strip, sir; I shall put you into your drawers presently.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> I shall be revenged, with putting you into your smock anon; St
George for me.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> St James for me: Come, start, sir.</p>

<hr class="hr1" />
<h3>TYRANNIC LOVE.</h3>

<p>The "Royal Martyr" is one of Dryden's most characteristic productions.
The character of Maximin, in particular, is drawn on his boldest plan,
and only equalled by that of Almanzor, in the "Conquest of Granada."
Indeed, although, in action, the latter exhibits a larger proportion of
that extravagant achievement peculiar to the heroic drama, it may be
questioned, whether the language of Maximin does not abound more with
the flights of fancy, which hover betwixt the confines of the grand and
the bombast, and which our author himself has aptly termed the Dalilahs
of the theatre. Certainly, in some of those rants which occasionally
burst from the emperor, our poet appears shorn of his locks; as for
example,</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i2">Look to it, Gods; for you the aggressors are:</span>
  <span class="i2">Keep you your rain and sunshine in your skies,</span>
  <span class="i2">And I'll keep back my flame and sacrifice;</span>
  <span class="i2">Your trade of heaven will soon be at a stand,</span>
  <span class="i2">And all your goods lie dead upon your hand.</span>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Indeed, Dryden himself acknowledged, in the Dedication to the "Spanish
Friar," that some verses of Maximin and Almanzor cry vengeance upon him
for their extravagance, and heartily wishes them in the same fire with
Statius and Chapman. But he pleads in apology, that he knew they were
bad enough to please, even when he wrote them, although he is now
resolved no longer to seek credit from the approbation of fools. Johnson
has doubted, with apparent reason, whether this confession be
sufficiently ample; and whether the poet did not really give his love to
those enticing seducers of his imagination, although he contemned them
in his more sober judgment. In the Prologue, he has boldly stated and
justified his determination to rush forwards, and hazard the disgrace of
a fall, rather than the loss of the race. Certainly a genius, which
dared so greatly as that of Dryden, cannot always be expected to check
its flight upon the verge of propriety; and we are often hurried along
with it into the extravagant and bombast, when we can seldom discover
the error till a second reading of the passage. Take, for example, the
often quoted account of the death of Charinus;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i2">With a fierce haste he led our troops the way;</span>
  <span class="i2">While fiery showers of sulphur on him rained;</span>
  <span class="i2">Nor left he, till the battlements he gained:</span>
  <span class="i2">There with a forest of their darts he strove,</span>
  <span class="i2">And stood, like Capaneus defying Jove.</span>
  <span class="i2">With his broad sword the boldest beating down,</span>
  <span class="i2">While fate grew pale, lest he should win the town,</span>
  <span class="i2">And turned the iron leaves of its dark book,</span>
  <span class="i2">To make new dooms, or mend what it mistook:</span>
  <span class="i2">Till sought by many deaths, he sunk, though late,</span>
  <span class="i2">And by his fall asserted doubtful fate.</span>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Although this passage, upon examination, will be found to contain much
tumid bombast, yet, like others in the same tone, it conveys, at first,
a dark impression of grandeur and sublimity, which only vanishes on a
critical examination. Such passages, pronounced with due emphasis on the
stage, will always meet with popular applause. They are like the
fanciful shapes into which a mist is often wreathed; it requires a near
approach, and an attentive consideration, to discover their emptiness
and vanity. On the other hand, we meet with many passages in Maximin,
where the impression of sublimity becomes more deep, in proportion to
the attention we bestow on them. Such is the speech of St Catharine to
her mother:</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i2">Could we live always, life were worth our cost;</span>
  <span class="i2">But now we keep with care what must be lost.</span>
  <span class="i2">Here we stand shivering on the bank, and cry,</span>
  <span class="i2">When we should plunge into eternity.</span>
  <span class="i2">One moment ends our pain;</span>
  <span class="i2">And yet the shock of death we dare not stand,</span>
  <span class="i2">By thought scarce measured, and too swift for sand:</span>
  <span class="i2">'Tis but because the living death ne'er knew,</span>
  <span class="i2">They fear to prove it, as a thing that's new.</span>
  <span class="i2">Let me the experiment before you try,</span>
  <span class="i2">I'll show you first how easy 'tis to die.</span>
 </div>
</div>

<p>In the same scene occurs an instance of a different kind of beauty, less
commonly found in Dryden. The tender description given by Felicia of her
attachment to her child, in infancy, is exquisitely beautiful.</p>

<p>The introduction of magic, and of the astral spirits, who have little to
do with the catastrophe, was perhaps contrived for the sake of music and
scenery. The supernatural has, however, been fashionable at all periods;
and we learn, from a passage in the dedication to "Prince Arthur,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
that the Duchess of Monmouth, whom Dryden calls his first and best
patroness, was pleased with the parts of airy and earthy spirits, and
with that fairy kind of writing, which depends upon the force of
imagination. It is probable, therefore, that, in a play inscribed to her
husband, that style of composition was judiciously intermingled, to
which our poet knew the duchess was partial. There is much fine
description in the first account of the wizard; but the lyrical dialogue
of the spirits is rather puerile, and is ridiculed, with great severity,
in the "Rehearsal."</p>

<p>Mr Malone has fixed the first acting of this play to the end of 1668, or
beginning of 1669. It was printed in 1670, and a revised edition came
forth in 1672.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 3em;">Sir,</span></p>

<p>The favourable reception which your excellent
lady afforded to one of my former plays<a name="FNanchor_B_12" id="FNanchor_B_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a>, has encouraged
me to double my presumption, in addressing this to your grace's
patronage. So dangerous a thing it is to admit a poet into your family,
that you can never afterwards be free from the chiming of ill verses,
perpetually sounding in your ears, and more troublesome than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
neighbourhood of steeples. I have been favourable to myself in this
expression; a zealous fanatick would have gone farther, and have called
me the serpent, who first presented the fruit of my poetry to the wife,
and so gained the opportunity to seduce the husband. Yet, I am ready to
avow a crime so advantageous to me; but the world, which will condemn my
boldness, I am sure will justify and applaud my choice. All men will
join with me in the adoration which I pay you; they would wish only I
had brought you a more noble sacrifice. Instead of an heroick play, you
might justly expect an heroick poem, filled with the past glories of
your ancestors, and the future certainties of your own. Heaven has
already taken care to form you for an hero. You have all the advantages
of mind and body, and an illustrious birth, conspiring to render you an
extraordinary person. The Achilles and the Rinaldo are present in you,
even above their originals; you only want a Homer, or a Tasso, to make
you equal to them. Youth, beauty, and courage (all which you possess in
the height of their perfection) are the most desirable gifts of heaven:
and heaven is never prodigal of such treasures, but to some uncommon
purpose. So goodly a fabric was never framed by an Almighty architect
for a vulgar guest. He shewed the value which he set upon your mind,
when he took care to have it so nobly, and so beautifully lodged. To a
graceful fashion and deportment of body, you have joined a winning
conversation, and an easy greatness, derived to you from the best, and
best-beloved of princes. And with a great power of obliging, the world
has observed in you a desire to oblige, even beyond your power. This,
and all that I can say on so excellent and large a subject, is only
history, in which fiction has no part; I can employ nothing of poetry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
in it, any more than I do in that humble protestation which I make, to
continue ever</p>

<h2><a name="THE_PREFACE2" id="THE_PREFACE2"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>I was moved to write this play by many reasons: Amongst others, the
commands of some persons of honour, for whom I have a most particular
respect, were daily sounding in my ears, that it would be of good
example to undertake a poem of this nature. Neither were my own
inclinations wanting to second their desires. I considered that pleasure
was not the only end of poesy; and that even the instructions of
morality were not so wholly the business of a poet, as that the precepts
and examples of piety were to be omitted. For, to leave that employment
altogether to the clergy, were to forget that religion was first taught
in verse, which the laziness, or dulness, of succeeding priesthood,
turned afterwards into prose; and it were also to grant (which I never
shall) that representations of this kind may not as well be conducing to
holiness, as to good manners. Yet far be it from me to compare the use
of dramatick poesy with that of divinity: I only maintain, against the
enemies of the stage, that patterns of piety, decently represented, and
equally removed from the extremes of superstition and profaneness, may
be of excellent use to second the precepts of our religion. By the
harmony of words we elevate the mind to a sense of devotion, as our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
solemn musick, which is inarticulate poesy, does in churches; and by the
lively images of piety, adorned by action, through the senses allure the
soul; which while it is charmed in a silent joy of what it sees and
hears, is struck, at the same time, with a secret veneration of things
celestial: and is wound up insensibly into the practice of that which it
admires. Now if, instead of this, we sometimes see on our theatres the
examples of vice rewarded, or, at least, unpunished; yet it ought not to
be an argument against the art, any more than the extravagances and
impieties of the pulpit, in the late times of rebellion, can be against
the office and dignity of the clergy.</p>

<p>But many times it happens, that poets are wrongfully accused; as it is
my own case in this very play; where I am charged by some ignorant or
malicious persons, with no less crimes than profaneness and irreligion.</p>

<p>The part of <i>Maximin</i>, against which these holy critics so much declaim,
was designed by me to set off the character of <i>St Catharine</i>. And
those, who have read the Roman history, may easily remember, that
Maximin was not only a bloody tyrant, <i>vastus corpore, animo ferus</i>, as
Herodian describes him; but also a persecutor of the church, against
which he raised the Sixth Persecution. So that whatsoever he speaks or
acts in this tragedy, is no more than a record of his life and manners;
a picture, as near as I could take it, from the original. If, with much
pains, and some success, I have drawn a deformed piece, there is as much
of art, and as near an imitation of nature, in a lazar, as in a Venus.
Maximin was an heathen, and what he speaks against religion, is in
contempt of that which he professed. He defies the gods of Rome, which
is no more than St Catharine might with decency have done. If it be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
urged, that a person of such principles, who scoffs at any religion,
ought not to be presented on the stage; why then are the lives and
sayings of so many wicked and profane persons, recorded in the Holy
Scriptures? I know it will be answered, That a due use may be made of
them; that they are remembered with a brand of infamy fixed upon them;
and set as sea-marks for those who behold them to avoid. And what other
use have I made of Maximin? have I proposed him as a pattern to be
imitated, whom, even for his impiety to his false gods, I have so
severely punished? Nay, as if I had foreseen this objection, I purposely
removed the scene of the play, which ought to have been at Alexandria in
Egypt, where St Catharine suffered, and laid it under the walls of
Aquileia in Italy, where Maximin was slain; that the punishment of his
crime might immediately succeed its execution.</p>

<p>This, reader, is what I owed to my just defence, and the due reverence
of that religion which I profess, to which all men, who desire to be
esteemed good, or honest, are obliged. I have neither leisure nor
occasion to write more largely on this subject, because I am already
justified by the sentence of the best and most discerning prince in the
world, by the suffrage of all unbiassed judges, and, above all, by the
witness of my own conscience, which abhors the thought of such a crime;
to which I ask leave to add my outward conversation, which shall never
be justly taxed with the note of atheism or profaneness.</p>

<p>In what else concerns the play, I shall be brief: For the faults of the
writing and contrivance, I leave them to the mercy of the reader. For I
am as little apt to defend my own errors, as to find those of other
poets. Only, I observe, that the great censors of wit and poetry,
either produce nothing of their own, or what is more ridiculous than any
thing they reprehend. Much of ill nature, and a very little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
judgment, go far in finding the mistakes of writers.</p>

<p>I pretend not that any thing of mine can be correct: This poem,
especially, which was contrived, and written in seven weeks, though
afterwards hindered by many accidents from a speedy representation,
which would have been its just excuse.</p>

<p>Yet the scenes are every where unbroken, and the unities of place and
time more exactly kept, than perhaps is requisite in a tragedy; or, at
least, than I have since preserved them in the "Conquest of Granada."</p>

<p>I have not everywhere observed the equality of numbers, in my verse;
partly by reason of my haste; but more especially, because I would not
have my sense a slave to syllables.</p>

<p>It is easy to discover, that I have been very bold in my alteration of
the story, which of itself was too barren for a play; and that I have
taken from the church two martyrs, in the persons of Porphyrius, and the
empress, who suffered for the Christian faith, under the tyranny of
Maximin.</p>

<p>I have seen a French play, called the "Martyrdom of St Catharine:" But
those, who have read it, will soon clear me from stealing out of so dull
an author. I have only borrowed a mistake from him, of one Maximin for
another; for finding him in the French poet, called the son of a
Thracian herdsman, and an Alane woman, I too easily believed him to have
been the same Maximin mentioned in Herodian. Till afterwards, consulting
Eusebius and Metaphrastes, I found the Frenchman had betrayed me into an
error, when it was too late to alter it, by mistaking that first Maximin
for a second, the contemporary of Constantine the Great, and one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
the usurpers of the eastern empire.</p>

<p>But neither was the other name of my play more fortunate; for, as some,
who had heard of a tragedy of St Catharine, imagined I had taken my plot
from thence; so others, who had heard of another play, called "L'Amour
Tyrannique," with the same ignorance, accused me to have borrowed my
design from it, because I have accidentally given my play the same
title; not having to this day seen it, and knowing only by report that
such a comedy is extant in French, under the name of "Monsieur Scudery."</p>

<p>As for what I have said of astral or aërial spirits, it is no invention
of mine, but taken from those who have written on that subject. Whether
there are such beings or not, it concerns not me; it is sufficient for
my purpose, that many have believed the affirmative; and that these
heroic representations, which are of the same nature with the epic, are
not limited, but with the extremest bounds of what is credible.</p>

<p>For the little critics, who pleased themselves with thinking they have
found a flaw in that line of the prologue,</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i2">And he, who servilely creeps after sense,</span>
  <span class="i2">Is safe, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_A_13" id="FNanchor_A_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a>,</span>
 </div>
</div>

<p>as if I patronized my own nonsense, I may reasonably suppose they have
never read Horace. <i>Serpit humi tutus</i>, &amp;c. are his words: He, who
creeps after plain, dull, common sense, is safe from committing
absurdities; but can never reach any height, or excellence of wit; and
sure I could not mean, that any excellence were to be found in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
nonsense. With the same ignorance, or malice, they would accuse me for
using&mdash;<i>empty arms</i>, when I write of a ghost, or shadow; which has
only the appearance of a body or limbs, and is empty, or void, of flesh
and blood; and <i>vacuis amplectitur ulnis</i>, was an expression of Ovid's
on the same subject. Some fool before them had charged me in "The Indian
Emperor" with nonsense in these words,</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i2">And follow fate, which does too fast pursue;</span>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Which was borrowed from Virgil, in the eleventh of

<p>I quote not these to prove, that I never writ nonsense; but only to
shew, that they are so unfortunate as not to have found it.</p>

  <span class="i2">Gallants, look to't, you say there are no sprites;</span>
  <span class="i2">But I'll come dance about your beds at nights.</span>
  <span class="i2">And faith you'll be in a sweet kind of taking,</span>
  <span class="i2">When I surprise you between sleep and waking.</span>
  <span class="i2">To tell you true, I walk, because I die</span>
  <span class="i2">Out of my calling, in a tragedy.</span>
  <span class="i2">O poet, damn'd dull poet, who could prove</span>
  <span class="i2">So senseless, to make Nelly die for love!</span>
  <span class="i2">Nay, what's yet worse, to kill me in the prime</span>
  <span class="i2">Of Easter-term, in tart and cheese-cake time!</span>
  <span class="i2">I'll fit the fop; for I'll not one word say,</span>
  <span class="i2">To excuse his godly out-of-fashion play;</span>
  <span class="i2">A play, which, if you dare but twice sit out,</span>
  <span class="i2">You'll all be slandered, and be thought devout.</span>
  <span class="i2">But, farewell, gentlemen, make haste to me,</span>
  <span class="i2">I'm sure e'er long to have your company.</span>
  <span class="i2">As for my epitaph when I am gone,</span>
  <span class="i2">I'll trust no poet, but will write my own:&mdash;</span>
  <span class="i2">Here Nelly lies, who, though she lived a slattern,</span>
  <span class="i2">Yet died a princess, acting in St Catharine.</span>

<i>Swash-buckler</i> seems to have been a title for those, who retained
the old blunt manners of Queen Elizabeth's time, when sword and buckler
were the common weapons. "Of old, when Englishmen were fenced with
bucklers, as with a rampier, nothing was more common with them, than to
fight about taking the right or left hand on the wall, or upon any
unpleasing countenance: clashing of swords was then daily music in every
street." <span class="smcap">Moryson's</span> <i>Itinerary</i>, Part III. Book iv.&mdash;The buckler was
disused in the latter end of Queen Elizabeth's reign; but those who
affected the old-fashioned, blunt, boisterous manners, common when that
ancient weapon was used in brawls, were, like old Moody in the play,
still termed <i>Swash-bucklers</i>.</p></div>

An excellent critical essay upon the beauties and defects of
Davenant's epic, may be found in Aikin's Miscellanies. Those who are
insensible to theme rits of the poem, may admire the courage of the
author, who wrote some part of it when he conceived himself within a
week of being hanged. A tradition prevails, that his life was saved by
Milton, whose life, in return, he saved at the Restoration. Were the
story true, how vast was the requital!</p></div>

William Cavendish, duke of Newcastle, distinguished himself in
the civil wars of Charles I. He might have possessed himself of Hull,
had the king more early resolved on an open rupture with the parliament.
When the war broke out, he levied an army of 8000 men, secured the
northern counties for the king, and raised the siege of York. The
invasion of the Scots prevented his farther success; but he defeated the
parliamentary forces in several actions, and shewed all the talents of a
great soldier. After the loss of the battle of Marston Moor, which
Prince Rupert hazarded in opposition to his advice, he left England in
disgust, and did not return till the Restoration. He was much respected
when abroad, and acquired the favour of many princes, and, amongst
others, of Don John of Austria. His skill in the equestrian art was,
perhaps, as great a recommendation, as his noble birth and unstained
loyalty. During the wars, he had been raised from the rank of earl to
that of marquis; and after the Restoration he was created duke of
Newcastle. He wrote several plays, of which we know only the names; "The
Country Captain," "Variety," "The Humourous Lovers," and "The Triumphant
Widow." He also translated Moliere's "<i>L'Etourdi,"</i> which our author
converted into "Sir Martin Mar-all". But his most noted work is a
splendid folio on Horsemanship, with engravings; in which, after his
grace has been represented in every possible attitude and dress, he is
at length depicted mounted on Pegasus, and in the act of ascending from
a circle of Houyhnhnms, kneeling around him in the act of adoration.</p>

<p>His once celebrated duchess was Margaret, daughter of Sir Charles Lucas.
She was his grace's second wife, and married to him during his exile. A
most voluminous author; she wrote nineteen plays, besides philosophical
essays, letters, and orations. For the former she has condescended to
leave the following apology:</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i2">The Latin phrases I could never tell,</span>
  <span class="i2">But Jonson could, which made him write so well.</span>
  <span class="i2">Greek, Latin poets I could never read,</span>
  <span class="i2">Nor their historians, but our English Speed.</span>
  <span class="i2">I could not steal their wit, nor plots out-take,</span>
  <span class="i2">All my plays plots my own poor brain did make.</span>
  <span class="i2">From Plutarch's story I ne'er took a plot,</span>
  <span class="i2">Nor from romances, nor from Don Quixote.</span>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Her grace's assiduity was equal to her originality. She kept a bevy of
maidens of honour, who were obliged, at all hours of the night, to
attend the summons of her bell, with a light, and materials "to register
her grace's conceptions," which, we beg the reader to understand, were
all of a literary or philosophical nature.</p>

<p>The good duchess's conceptions are now forgotten; but it should not be
forgotten, that her kind solicitude soothed and supported her husband
through a weary exile of eighteen years, when their fortunes were
reduced to the lowest ebb. In gratitude, he appears to have encouraged
her pursuits, and admired the productions of her muse. In the "Sessions
of Poets" he is introduced as founding upon her literary pretensions,
rather than his own.</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i2">Newcastle and's horse for entrance next strives,</span>
  <span class="i3">Well-stuffed was his cloak-bag, and so was his breeches,</span>
  <span class="i2">And &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;</span>
  <span class="i3">Pulled out his wife's poems, plays, essays, and speeches.</span>
  <span class="i2">Whoop! quoth Apollo, what a devil have we here?</span>
  <span class="i3">Put up thy wife's trumpery, good noble marquis,</span>
  <span class="i2">And home again, home again take thy career,</span>
  <span class="i3">To provide her fresh straw, and a chamber that dark is.</span>
 </div>
</div>

<p> Such were the noble personages whom Dryden deemed worthy of the fine
strains of eulogy conveyed in this dedication.</p></div>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
